(at home 2 days later)
i finally left Cerulian two days ago after telling Misty that i'll be home permanently for the next month,if she wishes ever a face to face meet up,she's all welcome anytime anyplace and returned home..

(2 days later,night)
Misty came today and just broke down straight away..i told her what i had to and this time also just about managed not to cry..i just went out on Charizard as i've always done many times in Kalos to get solitude..Pikachu is at Oak lab..i even send Mr. Mime away..i don't want any of my pokemons there..i'm at Viridian Forest now,Charizard in the ball..i'm at the crossing where we parted after Jhoto..i should've just destroyed her cycle again that day..sigh..
i'm not returning tonight but would be around 5:30 when Lillie will leave with Gary..then i'll enter only.. i'm actually lolling against Charizard,who's also sleeping and will return tomorrow to Liza..
