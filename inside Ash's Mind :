(in the pokemon centre)
i've come out of Misty's room 15 minutes ago..she fainted again as soon as she saw me..all my and her pokemon are alright..pikachu is with her pokemon now..Golduck straight went upto my lap and hugged me and won't get back in..after a lot of persuation he did finally budge..Misty has got back her consciousness now...it was foolish for me to suddenly appear like that,that too in hospital...the doctors also scolded me..it could've done her more harm...i just guess i should've let Tracy and Daisy stay and let them handle it first..but..Misty,i'm sorry,i for a moment thought you'll tolerate me for a bit...next time i should send Pikachu first..she understands Pikachu's words as well as i do..i guess Pikachu wants to be in her laps as well..he never no matter what agreed to battle her in all these years before yesterday...
(noon)
Misty did talk with Pikachu though he refuses to tell me what she said vehemently and i don't want to rile him up..he's not in a good mood may create a commotion..all my friends and others came and Misty has infact spoken with Brock and Tracy as well even with Gary,who also hasn't said anything...they all have left...Misty has refused to meet with me unless i can bring my friends from Kalos and Unova here..i've contacted Cilan,who actually sternly rebuked me saying he knew i was going overboard but finally did agree to talk with Misty via phone..Serena..i don't know what would happen..Serena was very annoyed with me but has decided to come..i did chide her after she just had got back home and then i did say that the only reason i don't bother about girls is that i have always had a very special one,didn't explain it further except warning her and later she broke down saying she was sorry and she never knew it as i didn't say anything and screamed back saying she would've been the first one to greet her if only she had known..my fault again i can now see,but i just never was in the mood to discuss about Misty with them,i just never saw them like that..but i have a hope that she can apprize Misty as she i guess was in a similar sort of a mess with my thoughts...Serena again affirmed after listening to everything today,that if I told her about Misty before she would've tried to talk to her herself..really i guess i've got a little sister there,which i guess i want at this moment..
(night)
Misty will return to the gym tomorrow and i'll have to leave..Serena will come the day after,Cilan has already spoken with Misty..but refused to tell me what he told her or how she took him..
(2 days later,late night)
Serena came today morning and will leave tomorrow..Misty has spoken to her and was very kind..really Serena you've done me a great service..Serena though told me that she didn't agree to meet me anytime soon...well i guess i'll have to force into the gym...
(next night)
thats it..i can't stay at the pokemon centre beyond tomorrow morning and i'll force myself into Cerulian Gym early tomorrow...all of Misty's sisters are there only...
(next morning)
i came early and they say they'll tell me when she wakes up..i'm just impatient...
(noon,with Misty)
it's been 2 hours since i finally could speak with Misty...i don't know how many emotions i'm having now..at first she won't talk but then when i showed the picture she kept under her pillow,she just burst into tears which i had to manage by hugging her...which almost made me cry as well as i couldn't believe how thin and weak she had become,her willpower only made her overwork at the gym and she showed all of its signs,just way too much swimming...after our battle it was the helpers who carried her out and barely noticed her abject physical state at that time and thought she was a bit weak with very little sleep..but i did never realize she was so weak and barely managed to carry on..
after a few moment of sobbing she just whispered to me to leave her alone to which i said i won't till atleast she listens my side of the story...which she did manage to hear..but then fell asleep out of tiredness...poor Mist..she's been sleeping and i'm still just beside her..i'm extremely tired myself..
(evening)
..Misty..it's nice that you'd open up finally...i think you and i still have a future...i really really am very optimistic...
Misty did tell me what went through her,which i myself could join in as i said i satyed in her room for all those days,to which she didn't react..but Misty out of blue said she didn't go insane only because of the good memories of our travels and that's what eabled her to keep her nerve in this whole year so that she somehow managed to stay away from becoming a mental wreck..i don't know how to react Mist.."i had forgotten you but not our travels..i was happiest back then,i guess i should've started my own journey as well rather being in the gym after a few months i'm tired being all alone,just too tired..leave Ash,let me rest"..and i should've taken up that Battle Frontier job not to leave you again,Mist..we would have had a family ourselves by now...poor Mist,as i thought before-Ash Ketchum hasn't left her head for 13 years..*sigh*..Misty can we be back togather again?..because,i couldn't forget you either and never will be able to..really Misty,i can't think of anything else except you when it comes to relationships or friendships or family or rivalry,never has since the day i met you though i was late to understand it and i know i won't be able to either..i never broke up with you intentionally,and neither did you,Misty..our stubborness only kept up that moment of heat for all this couple of years and it burnt you infinitely more as your feelings were way way deeper than mine...
i can still remember our breakup though..the last bit of it..
"so that's it are you saying then Mist?"
"yes,and it's Misty,Misty,Misty..don't nickname me.."
"i guess finally won't see you again then unless luck would have it"
"hey!don't try that with me ok?you know what,i still have your trophies from Battle Frontier and Sinnoh why don't you take them with you.."
"so trophies are what it is then?you don't like me winning these trophies now that you think my goal and subsequent public eye has made me forget you?"
"so,you mean you only started to win since i left you?..do me a favour..just go away Ash,you've just lost your genuinity to me..you don't have any value to me anymore.."
"Mist..."
"LEAVE!"
and that was it..she just went off into her room and didn't see her again till the other day in Daisy's video call...Misty did send back my two trophies she had back to my home via Tracy also i didn't find much of our mutual reminiscences either but she had a diary where she sparsely has mentioned a few things especially her mental state..she had a few books with very dark and gloomy theme and on cultivating psychic powers etc..and a few other stuffs..they aren't staying with you anymore Misty as i've got rid of every bit of those..i dont want you to harm yourself any further...
(an Year later)
I've won the title of Pokemon Master by managing to win the Elite 4 Challenge..and have moved in Cerulian City Gym with Misty..my mom will come here later next month when..
when finally i will marry Misty..finally..:)..,guess it should've happened four years back but as fate will have it we both had to go through this ordeal...
i can still remember all of that...
i finally left Cerulian after telling Misty that i'll be home permanently for the entire of next month,if she wishes ever a physical meet up,she's all welcome anytime anyplace and returned home..after reaching Pallet,Misty then came to my home alone and just broke down straight away...we finally patched up and lived there for a week,at which time she healed herself amusingly well then she forced me to compete in Elite 4 title as if i was to ever have a chance to be with her permanently only if i competed,that one week had erased away all the years of separation entirely thanks..:)...Misty!Misty!Misty! still perpetually and hopelessly hopefull on Ash..:)..in my mind i don't know how i managed to win again Lance in the first battle at Kanto with so little preparation but my heart know it's because of her only..had Mist not given me a chance,i would've been far away somewhere by now mentally and physically..me and Mist then travelled around for a year to compete across regions,this time it was only me and Mist,actually it's only that travel to a particualr place and train and compete thats all..which i managed 6-1,granting me a mention in Hall of Fame..but i said i'll just retire in the Cerulian City gym,which was now been disasocieted from Battle Frontier..Misty gets to be the Gym leader still..and i only kept Pikachu with me,the rest at Professor's lab and elsewhere..i have just decided to take up a job here as a helper and manager..i've seen from stand a few battles,which i don't know how i controlled myself not cheering Misty..hehe..and after every match she'll verbally thrash me with her typical high pitch for no apparent reason no matter whether she won or lost(which she hasn't yet..:)..it'll be very very,very hard to win against her for sure)..both of us know how much we enjoy it still and probably always will..:)..travelling with Misty last year brought up so many memories..it was our first as a couple to be honest..and didn't she like it!though we didn't have to walk and camp,we did end up doing that a bit just for enjoyment..it was a great experience for both of us..being in the gym has restricted my own activities but its not that i want to do those either..and i also told her that i'm officially a helper here now and won't fill in her place unless she is unable to take part in a battle or two just in case of emergency...
that's how i would like it to be...i do train the pokemons here though when Misty is busy..and the most thing that makes me happy is that Misty is exactly back at her 12 year self again mentally..always so boisterous and cheerfull..i get to enjoy it all so much being with her and it also makes me the 12 year old me,travelling with her..we're just very very happy togather and thats the way i want it to be..
(3 months later)
me and Misty are married now..:)..mom has also moved in here with us as well as Mr.Mime..running a gym as big as Cerulian is pretty difficult indeed..but surprizingly i havn't felt the urge to battle again..i just love to see Misty battling,her style flare and passion is absolutely gracefull and her methods are pretty brilliant always comes up with a surprize-i don't know why they just don't simply insert her name into the Hall of Fame as well,she already is definitely more than there..i'm really amused how a Gym leader can become so strong by simply sheer will..its an unique achievement really...and i just want to be amused by you all the time Mist..:)..
i myself don't know why i don't want to battle anymore but it's just the same with Pikachu,he hasn't lately even trained demanding to be always playfull..i guess he's just had enough after all these 14 years..we both have completely exhausted ourselves..i'll battle with Mist though everyday during training but that most of the time ends up in play with our pokemons when both of us choose ourselves to do the battling..:)..it's just all fun here..but Misty did tell me yesterday in all seriousness that i must be battling around again may be as the frontier head,to which i said i'm not leaving Cerulian anytime soon and if i feel like doing anything i'll just set up a local competetion here itself around the city..really i also realize i have to do something more sooner than later but i'm finally all to lazy to even think of it..i guess i could still start a farm..but that's not my thing really..haha..i guess i'll try it later...in the meantime we visited the lake from which Misty fished me out in good 'ol Viridian Forest..all those years ago..our first meeting..very special to her that place has been..i've never visited it since that first day despite passing around the forest so many times over the years and it was a brilliant time togather there camping...it also recharged my memories so much..it makes me feel like wanting to run away with Mist to the Orange Islands...

(two years later)
well yesterday our three little babies arrived..a triplet..:)..Misty is fine and overjoyed with the triplet although i guess her motherhood will be a bit difficult with all that they will do at the same time..:)..i can't describe my happiness either being a father with 3 kids..two boys and a girl..it's just heaven..:)..i have been running a local competetion here in Cerulian Outskirts of late..it's been going better than i thought it'll..i'm now extra motivated with our newborns...:)..
....................

Inside Misty's mind :

(the latest crowned Kanto Pokemon Master Ash Ketchum wishes to challenge you)..this is what i could hear in my dreams..rather nightmares as i had those everyday for an year or so..but this name and his demands simply got me out of myself..all these times for an year and half i'm trying to forget him so hard leading me to the brink of mental breakdown...damn it..i'll show you,you egotistical ...
(towards battlefield)
Ash Ketchum..Pokemon Master..nah! whats up with me? i don't care for a person who caused me so much pain over the last 18 months,whoose memory nothing can make me forget,nor my psychic adventures nor books nor all my gym battles-nothing...i seriously will break down mentally after today's match,but i must try to keep keep the honour of this Gym that some random bloke breaks in and gets to do whatever he wants because he's a Pokemon Master..i know he's trash talking only to play with my already out of control nerves..till i go insane..how could anyone have this audacity?..halt it might be a trick...to do what?he wants to beat me and then introduce me to his latest girlfriend and trophies and then thank me for the early days and memories and just leave with a smug look that i was never a match for him?..no i can't take it anymore,he's not going out of this place without being humiliated..
(upon arrival)
Ash Ketchum...i haven't seen him in the last two years except those papers that you get foisted on your face..he looks very calm from outside though..whats he's up to?..this is surely a man with great determination and composure i've never seen except in Elite 4..nah!what are you thinking Misty,he's here to put the final knail in your coffin...i must get ready..but..well we did break up didn't we,so if i told the press without naming you and defamed you? only if i reminded him that before i accepted,but then again my reputation won't help me either that i've become a mental wreck and spitting out anything?..i'm really backed to a corner..just battle..win or lose i'll go to a mental asylum after this one as anyhow he'll humiliate me more and i won't be ab;e to take it anymore..MISTY!...BATTLE...
(during Golduck vs Pikachu)
pikachu?!?..even you PikaPi?..you never battled me ever before and i didn't imagine you to emerge last..for some reason i thought you didn't come with him today as i didn't notice you..and you agreed to get into a ball?..to remind me if you did so in the first place i would have never met Ash?..but you will take his side no matter whether you liked it or not won't you?..i can't take it anymore..
but why is Pikachu looking at me like as if pleading with me..he'll always be with Ash..it hurts me out of bounds that i am being cheated by Ash in a battle by means of Pikachu of all Pokemons..my PikaPi,which infact are his words for 'Misty'..
(Ash says i'm returning the favour only,you're the one who cheated first)
i can't think..i just don't have any strenght to keep standing anymore..Ash Ketchum,Ash Ketchum-my once most cherished dream..now..now just has taken away the light out of my head..first he shows he's way better than me at my very own game being able to beat me 0-7 in the 7 so far and finally cheating as if to get himself disqualified on purpose so that i get to save my face...and then..i can't believe you would ever say that Ash..ever..i cheated right?..i cheated and you were just enjoying yourself,i broke up and you were just being a little moody that day,i was the one to date anyone that would appear at the door while you were only being good friends,i was jealous of your success,i was holding you back while cheating on you and feiging that i care for you while you were being the definition of innocence,i only broke up cause i was unable to hide the fact anymore that i was indeed cheating on you..cheating,cheating,always cheating since i first met you..i'm going insane now...GOLDUCK... 
(after waking up at hospital and talking with Daisy)
i don't know how i've still stayed sane...and even managed to sob only a little...i got beaten with water pokemons at my own gym 0-7 before being utterly humiliated if the previous result wasn't enough...no Ash didn't cheat in any of those 7 but simply showed he was way way better...
i should just move in near her or Lillie and do get way from the Gym now that he showed i'm just not in his league at all in my own gym in my own game...i know how Ash got me all riled up waking me up after 1 hour of sleep and i just got played all into his hands,he has killed me entirely..but Tracy and Gary..well doesn't matter Violet is busy and any or all of those will now have to either return to the Gym or sell it out..irony isn't it sis?you had to drag me here forcing to depart my journey all those years ago and now you'll be dragged back..i surely am not going back..but it pains me to be in Pallet..no i should've just stayed in Orange or anywhere..Ash,why don't you just leave me alone?..the Gym was my last hope and you humiliated me there as well..i just don't want to know what's happening with you and don't want you to interfare in my life that's all...is that too much to ask for,Ash?...do i have to bow down to your girlfriends and admit that it was all my fault that i ever liked you in the first place or as you accused me then that i cheated on you?...
(Upon seeing Ash)
why is he here?WHY IN THE WORLD IS HE HERE?...this man now would go on a sentimental spree to coax me into another trap and i again will get a nerve rackage..i can't stay awake anymore..
(after talking with friends and family)
No..i woke up with tears in my eyes,surely i shouldn't have been this rude to Brock and Tracy throughout..i was blind..they didn't do any harm to me..but i just didn't want to see them to forget my times with Ash..that name hasn't left me since i first heard it..won't it ever leave me?..but i guess it's my fault..i should've moved on with some guy..there were a few who did have good concern for me..but i just,no i guess i just can't forget Ash still even after yesterday...
(after meeting Pikachu)
atleast his pokemon hasn't forgotten me..i don't think Pikachu of all will really repeat whatever he told him..he has to stay with him no matter what so what would he gain in either case? or Ash Ketchum would you leave your Pikachu too some day like you did with me?didn't you tell me i meant as much to you as did Pikachu if not more all those years ago?can you throw him away as easily as you did with me?...Pikachu only told me to give him a chance,well lets see..and i thought Gary implied it too..though i wasn't nice to him exactly..
(after damnding Kalos Friends)
i must know what Ash was doing in Kalos..only then may be i'll see him again..all those days trying to practise psychic powers with Golduck didn't really help my nerves i guess..otherwise why would i lose 0-7 in an emotional challenge..still that name along with Ash haunts me and Golduck probably didn't want to fight him either..why would he?..he knows Ash for years..its strange how Pokemon can understand human emotions and refuses to fight people they once thought were very close to,if only they knew the real motives..lets see what happens..
(After talking with Cilan)
i never met this guy before though Ash did tell me about him..well this guy is as straight as you can get..just said that Ash was not doing the right things in his personal life at Unova but his concern and care for his Pokemons and Battles were only getting ever better..nothing could affect Ash when he was with his Pokemon and Cilan thought he saw only an ever exuberent child whenever Ash was with his Pokemon..child..if only you knew the 12 year old Ash i knew so well-that's just battle and pokemon..i was foolish if i ever thought he'll grow up and mature..when he did just went away from me..

(after meeting Serena)

so basically he's trying to show me that he has always been very firm..and that picture of someone kissing him in public while he held her hand didn't mean he also gave into the craze surrounding him..and probably he let people to fondle with him more than he should've..i do realize how many people wanted our attention in sensational four days..Serena seems to be a very sweet girl indeed..and i perfectly understand her emotions of dreaming about somebody for many years...atleast she got a proper clarification and i guess she has a conviction about Ash..is it possible that he has also realized his mistakes at Kalos?..Serena affirmed as did Cilan that Ash became very interested in Gadgets and Mental side of pokemon battles since later parts of Unova and in Kalos he would hike less and be in the cities or towns rather and study many things go to libraries or to professors,doctors and all,while he has learnt to cook and all the things you need from Cilan,he has become a matured man indeed as it would seem but as Serena said he has also become a bit elusive going through philosophical battle books and gadget books night after night yet managing to stay as fresh as ever and his behaviour is extremely caring as they would say,infact Gary said this as well that Ash has become worlds apart in the last two years,the few times he was interviewd he just strangely brushed them aside with some abstruce talks and strange looks but his handling of pokemon has gone to a different level as he managed to win Kalos as a all time record never losing a single Pokemon in all his 9 matches including the final,which is a record there..but what did he mean that he already has someone?..he would be utterly immature to think he'll ever be back with me again cause i wont just after all that he caused me to go through..and Serena said all he only ever told her on being quizzed over his intellectual pursuits was that change was required urgently..Professor Oak also did speak with me before Serena came and he said Ash has become indeed a very thoughtful person,but he thinks its a very good change and he has never felt Ash to be so warm yet content in his life and it's pretty hard to understand what's going through his mind anytime which was the most obvious thing about him before but his fear is that Ash isn't cheerful anymore at all rather being a bit dejected all times not exactly knowing whether to appreciate his own achievements or not..
i don't know why but this loss to Ash has got rid of my mental burden..i didn't need to be obsessed with the Gym and all this just to get away from his memories..but then again its not that i didn't try..but i couldn't..
(meeting Ash)
all these words..i'm dizzy really...
(waking up after meeting ash and sleeping)
i could sense an extremely firm sincierity in Ash,which is strange to be honest but fits with what i've heard about him,which strangely has pre occupied my mind since i got back my consciousness days ago the second time..i can't shed his thoughts and wanted to know more and more about him..
but i never heard this voice ever from him..but i don't believe him..he also gave his phone to me to check if he ever called me after breakup-which i did and did find to be true,though he never gave this personal contact to me as he says he got it before Kalos its actually a very advanced gadget which isn't available in market,i saw this when i last visited Professor Oak 3 years ago..he had just got it and showed us just how helpfull it could be but also firmly told us to keep it secret..well only me,Gary and Tracy saw this..keeping it is illegal unless you're an Elite 4 or someone like Professor Oak,which means its infact Professor Oak's..but its been two years and each of his words were pretty genuine it seemed..unless..but again all this can't be a set up to cajole me into something,he has everything and to be honest he if he wants can easily get into Elite 4 and can be in a relationship with anybody-he doesn't have to be infatuated with me,he can't drag me with him all he wanted..but he has become a man of firm conviction?.."finally to sum up,i don't care for your thoughts but all i want to tell you is that i've never given into immorality in my life-thats my final word to you on my side and i'm hoping to hear from you as well"..outside his battles..but how can a man without those qualities get a Pokemon Master title and keep winning leagues no matter what was in his mind..anyhow i'll tell him my side as well..how he has caused me so much pain from basically the first day..all of it..Ash Ketchum has left me high and dry for all these 13 years..it must come to an end..may be even i can then finally be able to forget him..which i must i have my whole life lfet to live..i really should've been more frank to him when we broke up two years back..
(after telling ash about my side)
..ah!finally..i do feel very light now..i guess i won't have the nightmares anymore..but i'll still keep this sketch from Orange..i guess only because i wont be travelling again like that..really after all these years i guess i can't forget how happy i was then..but i don't know whether i'll be ever back to that sort of happiness again..*sigh*..if only..anyhow i can't think anymore..
(after Ash leaves with an invitation to Pallet)
Ash,why are you torturing me for 13 years,everyday,still?..he was definitely sincire that day but again just sold me a bait by inviting..this boy is playing with my emotions for so many years,i'm tired very tired..
Ash you may think that it has been more difficult for you than me but i'm just not in the mood of all that sweet talk again and again,okay? just after few days of that nightmare at this very Gym just downstairs...i'll take years as you did yourself Ash,deal with it..then i can still reject you after keeping you hanging for two years if you still hope i'll come back to you..you'll move around hopelessly in hope and then get to see what heartbreak you have...but,i really can't do that..it breaks me down even to think of the pain that i went through because of Ash and besides i'll have to be dishonest with myself the most as well then,which i won't be able to be..ever..well,i'm just too stressed out..i'll think later...
(3 days later)
no i will go to Pallet with my sisters..and must talk with Ash..atleast it'll be a change,i'm getting choked up here in the Gym...i'm undecided still whether i should go back with him or not but i can't keep it suppressed anymore i guess..why did you call me a cheat?..
(in ash's home,night)
i guess i just couldn't help but to reconcile with Ash...he has some sort of psychic hold over me that makes me to fall for him all the time..but..but,i just can't think of anyone else at all,never will be and never did..
..and,and neither could he...now,now i know that..:)..the very first thing he did,as if he was waiting for me to arrive was to even before entering through the main door just warmly gave me a hug,and his tearful face had an expression of joy which has made me follow him all these years and it did its magic again..i did break down instantly..then..
"i will cheat all i want as if only you/cheating loyal you're ever as i'm for you"..i was left dumbstruck to be honest for a few moments as he let me go as soon as he said that rhyme and just went away from the house..and left me thinking all day,i can't believe the king of dense people Ash Ketchum could spit out a dense rhyme like that...what magic has Kalos done to you Ash?..i infact have just ended up laughing my head off while i've just finished my contemplation on the whole affair even in this situation..i know you since you're 12..you didn't even know how to catch a pokemon when i first met you..you had no clue about anything..:)..and now you're a poet all of a sudden..no matter what i must visit Kalos myself as well...but i'm happy,i really am...i've just realized what you mean Ash Ketchum,you can't hide yourself from me no matter what..we're being right if only we're being with with each other no matter what we're being-loyal or cheats..whether we're with each other or someone else-we're just meant for each other in this life..and this is the last time i would doubt that and even think about that..:)..tomorrow we're getting officially back Ash Ketchum..:)..we never really did break up and so rather than being nice which i was when we first became a couple as a huge mistake from my part otherwise i'm damn sure you would've been kept not only grounded but way below ground level,this time i'll just eat your little head up,you'll see..:)..lyrics right?..you'll see epics tomorrow..:)..
it feels very very good...i guess i'm back to being 12 year old Misty again..:)..but i must catch a sleep and finally i'm sure to have a peacefull one..



Inside Misty's mind:
(afternoon)
Ah!..it felt so good tormenting Ash all morning..and i do know how much he enjoyed it,though i could see how embarassad he looked but we all are against him now..poor Mrs Ketchum was shocked at my behaviour but certainly has joined us happily only after a few moments..haha..she has consented me to call her Mom,which i so much enjoy..:)..i just haven't been able to express myself like this..:)..i'm in heavens really...and all your dear books are with me now,Ash Ketchum as well as your illegal gadget which i'm not giving you at all..and i'm not giving your darling trophies back back ever again,besides these all are now also mine and same will be the fate of any thing you ever will have and you have to give me a ring to even make me take remote care of your belongings..:)..and also you must now even ask me to give your dress so that you can go outside of the house,which you're not allowed to as of now and you'll do whatever is my command,basically i choose you Ash Ketchum..:)..oh and all your pokemons are mine now,just leave them with me,ok..idiot..:)..
(night)
Ash has just fallen asleep sometime ago..i'm at the window,stargazing with my PikaPi and Starmie..i really guess i went a bit too far today with Ash,tormenting him all day long..hehe..but couldn't help it..it has never felt this good for ages..:).. 



(an year later)
I'm back at being Cerulian Gym leader again without the extra responsibility of the Frontier Symbol with my would be husband Ash Ketchum..our marriage is due later this month..finally..:)..i can't express my happiness..Ash did win the Elite 4 title but is again sitting here idle just to be with me at every step but i'll make sure he opens up a competetion around Cerulian..i don't want to be away from him at all as well..
the Elite 4 was great..i could travel around with my Ash all alone everywhere in the world as fiancees..that really i only could dream..but it really was great..it has revitalized my own will and skills being away from the Gym for a relatively long time,when Gary filled in,which means i'm having to rebuild the reputation again as he hadn't battled in ages and was more interested in the challenger's pokemon than the battle..gosh..poor Gary..:)..i met with so many people that became Ash's friends when i was not around and it was always grand..Ash won in Kalos,Unova,Sinnoh,Hoenn,Jhoto and Indigo losing in Orange only..but it has had a strange effect on him..as he won his very first championship here the Orange league and it would've made it 7-0 for him a clean sweep,but he doesn't like that particular thing,i taunted him so many times with that "cheat" thing he rhymed he only giggles but whenever i mention our final battle or 7-0 he just becomes very grave and doesn't like to hear that at all..i told him i don't hold anything against him as he knows,but he just..i guess it pains him still that he behaved to me like a monster..and no i only get to see the funny side of it now and later scolded and forced him to see so as well as i told that we shouldn't let any dark corners unturned,to which he did giggle oblige and he has forced me not to mention battling again anytime soon..i just guess somehow he felt a circle has been completed and wishes to rest..and he needs it for sure,i've travelled him him now for an year and can see his exhaustion..but i'm having so much fun now being with Ash here that i don't want him to leave either..he has become a person that i can barely believe..i'm really lucky to have him..really..:)..
i'm so happy that Mrs Ketchum will move in with us as well next month,i get to feel that my own mom is back again at Cerulian Gym..:)..i am so lucky really to have a full family here at the gym itself...:)..
i've got all of Ash's water types as well which has made this place all the more strong,and i've just about figured how Ash beat me 0-7 that day..none of my pokemon ever wanted to battle any of his and the whole thing was a well led plan by Ash..he let each of his pokemon to say that 'this fight is only to get your master back with ours as they're only doing it cause your master isn't paying our master enough attention of late like couples do after a catfight'..something like that..haha..he recored a chorus of this from all the different water pokemons that he had with another illegal device that converted this recording into a sound wavelength that humans could never even detect without sophisticated instruments and he connected this device with amplifiers that he secretly planted around the gym,where he sneaked into at late night and  after using Butterfrees to make the helpers sleep,he didn't use pokemons at all so that there was no noise and nothing was heard upstairs and he did all this for a limited time and then went away-but he could do all this cause he bribed a few Gym Guards with a Bulbasaur each,who are pretty indespensible if you want to control a water Gym while showing them who he was and the few of our letters during our first relationship that he kept at his home,making sure the guards just knew that he was here to help as my reputation none liked cause i changed so much and always was so depressed,the few pokemon guards that still didn't comply were managed by a hoard of Wisings,which he procured from Lance,the Elite 4 of Kanto..and used this device secretly with an amplifier during the match.. 
this whole plan made all of my battling and gym pokemons confused as to whether this was a real battle or just fun and then also very wisely he chose only those which were familier to me and my pokemons and kept the winner a bit longer only to get the referee a bit agitated while he managed his device and while the Pokemon would say those words aloud again to somehow get the attention of the other gym pokemons while Ash played his tricks and if the newcoming pokemon from me was unknown to Ash's the Gym pokemon's behaviour will confuse it just that bit..amusing mind game,Ash Ketchum..and you knew i was out of my mind with anger and despondency to notice all or any of this..you should apply for a job in Team Rocket Ash,yup,thats what would fit you the most..haha..but as i fainted screeming 'Golduck',Golduck just panicked and shouted help to all at the gym and going overboard..Ash did expect Golduck to obey me the most and that i'll choose him the last because he was informed by Gary,who somehow with his bafflingly brilliant intuition thought i was with Psychic types all the time and then Ash deduced that Psyduck being my first and a very powerfull one i would choose it..well Starmie was actually the first but Golduck was much stronger..then Pikachu who travelled for such a long time with Pshyduck all those years ago during his initial stages,just told Golduck 'hey are you out of your mind bro? this is like a family drama we're just role playing' or something like that i guess but it was me who managed to frighten Golduck more than Pikachu and Ash's trash talking would confuse him..Ash barely managed us from getting killed..once again as we got togather,we surely are not a normal couple far from it..:)..Ash says he somehow thought Golduck might be a little difficult to handle in case i faint or something out of mental pressure..and all his trash talks were perfectly prepared and timed and as i told him in return of his brash statemnts only that i didn't want to see him again he just inferred i still may have feelings for him as he heard from my sisters back home and got confirmed as i didn't tell him that i can announce too in public that someone was the reason for my mental condition while specifying his name which in fact was what he expected and thought of retorting with the official breakup and cheating thing..but i just virtually told him that he still gives me mental pain and he realized i was still wanting to reconcile with him somehow,really he just gauged me inside out..:)..unfair Ash Ketchum,very unfair again..:)..i made him to see the funny side of it and but he still is rather dissapointed as he really was playing with my nerves,which were really stressed out already and he knew it..but he had to take care of so many things..as 1.i could've fallen inside the pool for which he took Ganger and Squirtel so that he could directly confront Golduck while trying to save me though Pikachu then wouldn't have been able to electrify the pool that quickly and some pokemons could've emerged from underwater by breaking the underwater barriers,which Ash thought of confronting with the pokemons he had used in his battle but they would've been weak so in the end he just told Squirtel to throw my body up and and prepared Charizard-Bulbasaur combination to get me out,Charizard as he could evaporate water and fly away very quickly,though if he tried to break through the walls or roof it was all on Bulbasaur to protect me somehow,which was a responsibility that needed inch perfect precision and Bulbasaur was the only one who Charizard trusted on his back except Ash himself if they were alone..if my helpers did something or the pokemons did create a bigger issue Ash said he would've released his Taurose herd to have a head on collision with the charging rescue party approaching the exact spot..and he said he only had to pick those who knew me intimately so that they'll give their all to protect me,and Ash recored another pokemon chorus to say "please keep calm,your master is only being rescued,if you panick your master may be harmed more" but he had only one small amplifier so he wasn't sure how much of help that would've been..and there were so many other things that could've gone wrong..i said what if i didn't faint or simply won,he said we would've had to make you so then somehow and then said he was pretty confident of winning..when i forced him in this matter that there were just too many risks and factors to handle,he just stopped me saying all that matters is that we're alive-which is pretty true indeed..
Ash just told me that he always thought we just couldn't give up on each other that easily..when you've known someone from the age age of 12,i just realize that our separation as well was only fun and game..:)..but i do understand why he is always a bit dissapointed with that event..
he got away with those devices simply by apprizing Lance,who was concerned about my well being and the gym as well and Ash then told him all our past and got the help,his travels to and fro was managed by Charizard,who has left me dizzy as he took me alone from here to Pettlesburg to meet May so quickly that i barely managed it..i'm not riding on you again Charizard and neither is Ash its too dangerous..and the culprit says he had travelled in such a manner many times in Kalos without telling anyone,stupid idiot,you're not getting to do that ever again and it's funny how he and Charizard both thinks its not at all unsafe and thats why he let me try it but Charizard wont allow anyone else on his back alone while he's going at that speed expect Ash,Bulbasaur and me,as other pokemons dont give him "respect" which he asserts is his real food,respect meaning the major portion of their drinks and persons as they are 'too heavy or light' which is the proper amount of drink that he's given compared to other pokemons after the job is over..some pokemon this is..and while i scoffed that Charla wouldn't be so moody,he flamethrowed me which is "don't get her into this,she never paid attention,when we learnt how to manage our tail flame if we fell into the sea,always fooling around with a bunch of blokes i will crush if i see them around anywhere"...haha..Charizard is Charizard..
but Ash sitting in the stand while i fight against challengers is something that i feel a bit strange about,cause it was always the other way around before most times..but he doesn't cheer for me at all,which i always find precious to torment him about..:).. he's just observing and later passing on his opinions in training and to the challenger..this makes things so much better for the challengers as they can relate to Ash more easily..he is though very reluctant to fill in but certainly does when i don't feel like battling..and as usual he doesn't have a clue how to use only one type of pokemon one after another-still..:)..though i don't know how he manages..neither does he,but that's my Ash..:)..nobody has really got a grip even in all these years so as to how he gets things done with some unimaginable moves..but he'll always be a million miles behind me in swimming pool which is an eternal advantage in training and playing with all the pokemons..:)..i know what our secret is both he and me..we're just too intuitive sensitive caring and stuborn-thats all..its always difficult to manage things for such people talk about Battles or personal life..
(two years later)

Inside Ash's mind :

(an year later)

our kids are doing great and we're just impatent for them to start talking with us...:)..I'm now feeling in for Misty as being Cerulian Gym leader..which i will continue for a few years more..i'm also running the competetion inter Cerulian Contest which gives a platform for special type of trainers to show their skills like fire,water,grass,sand...setting up the huge facility was pretty troublesome but i managed to get both the space and consent..getting to know about how to be a Gym leader myself though is a bit strange to me,though i've been seeing Misty and all others for all these years,its just strange to me..haha..i guess i'll always be the one to challenge rather than to accept in a Gym..i still like it so much the looks of a few trainers-'just gimme the damn badge would ya?'..haha..similar to me..that's just who i'm..Pikachu though has officially retired,neither me nor Mist could get him to battle again anywhere..i forced Professor Oak to come here out of complete retirement,but he just laughed him off saying Pikachu's view is that i've given you all that you ever dreamed of..literally..now just leave me alone..infact Pikachu himself didn't make a family which Professor Oak says that's how it is with Pikachu's..a rare few are indeed very moody and mine is a standout example among them i guess..professor oak infact says he's yet to fully comprehend how i tamed him in the first place and how he infact have him to me to bein with himself..but i've been lucky there haven't i..:)..just now Pikachu is trying to sneak into the kitchen to steal some food (or is it drink?) i guess another round of bickering with Mr Mime is due anytime...i don't say anything though as he thunderbolts anybody that tells him to battle or tries to dictate him forcefully..he doesn't even want to watch the Gym battles and would only be with me when it's time to eat..really Charizard is as docile as you can imagine compared to this little pest now,always fooling around and even i don't understand him much in these days as well as Mist does,Pikachu would rather be with her while she isn't battling than be with me..this is real chating Mist..haha..i guess Pikachu never wanted to face her but that day is still fresh in his memories when he knew we were doing illegal things..he did do as well as ever but since my final match at Orange in Elite 4,just decided to quit it all and be with Mist as if to make up for the mistakes..i did know my Pikachu was very sensitive to human emotions but he really has baffled me..to me he has always been just like a human and both Mist and mom agree too and Professor Oak also did confirm it..there were only two Pikachus known to have shown similar behaviour but that was a long long time ago and both belonged to two different Pokemon Masters who passed away 300 and 432 years ago respectively..i thought mine has a connection with them but then i was informed that none of those two Pikachus had any family just like mine..my Pikachu is unique indeed but thats what my Pikachu is,isn't he?..:)..really Pikachu,where would i ever be without you..:)..enjoy yourself all your life buddy...
my life feels really completed now..i have somehow managed to achieve every goal that i had set myself out to in my wildest dreams when i left home at 12..now at 30 it just feels like i'm really ready to pass on my knowledge to the coming generations for as many years and even further..on everything from Pokemon to life to hell ethics and philosophy..:)..i just feel so content and happy i really can't describe myself..all now i want to do is to help as many people as i can,i have nothing left for me to achive or get now...really my zeal got me all exhausted within just 29 years of life,but i'm just happy i realized the dreams that i dreamt ever..:)..
