(an Year later)
I've won the title of Pokemon Master by managing to win the Elite 4 Challenge..and have moved in Cerulian City Gym with Misty..my mom will come here later next month when..
when finally i will marry Misty..finally..:)..,guess it should've happened four years back but as fate will have it we both had to go through this ordeal...
i can still remember all of that...

...we finally patched up and lived there for a week,at which time she healed herself amusingly well then she forced me to compete in Elite 4 title as if i was to ever have a chance to be with her permanently only if i competed,that one week had erased away all the years of separation entirely thanks..:)...Misty!Misty!Misty! still perpetually and hopelessly hopefull on Ash..:)..in my mind i don't know how i managed to win again Lance in the first battle at Kanto with so little preparation but my heart know it's because of her only..had Mist not given me a chance,i would've been far away somewhere by now mentally and physically..me and Mist then travelled around for a year to compete across regions,this time it was only me and Misty,actually it's only that travel to a particualr place and train and compete thats all..which i managed 6-1,granting me a mention in Hall of Fame..but i said i'll just retire in the Cerulian City gym,which was now been disasocieted from Battle Frontier..Misty gets to be the Gym leader still..and i only kept Pikachu with me,the rest at Professor's lab and elsewhere..i have just decided to take up a job here as a helper and manager..i've seen from stand a few battles,which i don't know how i controlled myself not cheering Misty..hehe..and after every match she'll verbally thrash me with her typical high pitch for no apparent reason no matter whether she won or lost(which she hasn't yet..:)..it'll be very very,very hard to win against her for sure)..both of us know how much we enjoy it still and probably always will..:)..travelling with Misty last year brought up so many memories..it was our first as a couple to be honest..and didn't she like it!though we didn't have to walk and camp,we did end up doing that a bit just for enjoyment..it was a great experience for both of us..being in the gym has restricted my own activities but its not that i want to do those either..and i also told her that i'm officially a helper here now and won't fill in her place unless she is unable to take part in a battle or two just in case of emergency...
that's how i would like it to be...i do train the pokemons here though when Misty is busy..and the most thing that makes me happy is that Misty is exactly back at her 12 year self again mentally..always so boisterous and cheerfull..i get to enjoy it all so much being with her and it also makes me the 12 year old me,travelling with her..we're just very very happy togather and thats the way i want it to be..

me and Misty are married now..:)..mom has also moved in here with us as well as Mr.Mime..running a gym as big as Cerulian is pretty difficult indeed..but surprizingly i havn't felt the urge to battle again..i just love to see Misty battling,her style flare and passion is absolutely gracefull and her methods are pretty brilliant always comes up with a surprize-i don't know why they just don't simply insert her name into the Hall of Fame as well,she already is definitely more than there..i'm really amused how a Gym leader can become so strong by simply sheer will..its an unique achievement really...and i just want to be amused by you all the time Mist..:)..
i myself don't know why i don't want to battle anymore but it's just the same with Pikachu,he hasn't lately even trained demanding to be always playfull..i guess he's just had enough after all these 14 years..we both have completely exhausted ourselves..i'll battle with Mist though everyday during training but that most of the time ends up in play with our pokemons when both of us choose ourselves to do the battling..:)..it's just all fun here..but Misty did tell me yesterday in all seriousness that i must be battling around again may be as the frontier head,to which i said i'm not leaving Cerulian anytime soon and if i feel like doing anything i'll just set up a local competetion here itself around the city..really i also realize i have to do something more sooner than later but i'm finally all to lazy to even think of it..i guess i could still start a farm..but that's not my thing really..haha..i guess i'll try it later...in the meantime we visited the lake from which Misty fished me out in good 'ol Viridian Forest..all those years ago..our first meeting..very special to her that place has been..i've never visited it since that first day despite passing around the forest so many times over the years and it was a brilliant time togather there camping...it also recharged my memories so much..it makes me feel like wanting to run away with Mist to the Orange Islands...
