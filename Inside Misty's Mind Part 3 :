Inside Misty's Mind Part 3 :

Inside Misty's mind:
(afternoon)
Ah!..it felt so good tormenting Ash all day..and i do know how much he enjoyed it,though i could see how embarassad he looked but we all are against him now..poor Mrs Ketchum was shocked at my behaviour but certainly has joined us happily only after a few moments..haha..she has consented me to call her Mom,which i so much enjoy..:)..i just haven't been able to express myself like this..:)..i'm in heavens really...and all your dear books are with me now,Ash Ketchum as well as your phone i'm not giving you at all..and i'm not giving your darling trophies back back ever again,besides these all are now also mine and same will be the fate of any thing you ever will have and you have to give me a ring to even make me take remote care of your belongings..:)..and also you must now even ask me to give your dress so that you can go outside of the house,which you're not allowed to as of now and you'll do whatever is my command,basically i choose you Ash Ketchum..:)..oh and all your pokemons are mine now,just leave them with me,ok..idiot..:)..
(1 at night)
Ash has just fallen asleep 15 minutes ago only..i'm at the window,stargazing with my PikaPi Bulbasaur and Starmie..i really guess i went way too far today with poor Ash,tormenting him all day long..hehe..and he didn't sleep at all last night,swimming for about two hours constantly in Viridian Forest lake before returning..came back as if a completely heartbroken person and went into his room..now he's face looks extremely peacefull and happy..have a nice rest dear..i've also let Bulbasaur use sleep powder so that Ash gets an even better sleep...
Ash was so happy to see me accept him again..we just can't be separated,Ash Ketchum,you and be always together..:).. I just couldn't help but to torment him to the extreme today..haha..it has never felt this good for ages..:)..

Inside Misty's Mind :
(next night)
Finally engaged to Ash..:)..he should've done this years ago but it doesn't matter..he couldn't have done it 10 years ago when we were 15 could he..haha..but what i really want  is that he competes in Elite 4 Challenge and so that we get to travel togather again,which i actually want as my honeymoon with Ash..:)..and i also demand from him that he gets a name in the Hall of Fame book..that will be a real dream come true for both of us...
