Inside Misty's Mind Part 4 :

(an year later)
I'm back at the Cerulian Gym Leader position without the extra responsibility of the Frontier Symbol...
with my husband Ash Ketchum..yup i'm Misty Ketchum now officially and finally..:)..
our marriage was on last week and mom has also moved in here three days ago permanently..i am so lucky really to have my new family with me here at the gym itself...:)..
Ash did win the Elite 4 title but is again sitting here idle just to be with me at every step but i'll make sure he opens up a competetion around Cerulian..i don't want to be away from him at all as well..
the Elite 4 was great..i could travel around with my Ash all alone everywhere in the world as fiancees..that really i only could dream..but it really was great..it has revitalized my own will and skills being away from the Gym for a relatively long time,when Daisy filled in,which means i'm having to rebuild the reputation again as she hadn't battled in ages and was more interested in the how the challenger's pokemon's looked beautiful or not than the battle..gosh..poor Daisy..:)..i met with so many people that became Ash's friends when i was not around and it was always grand..Ash won in Kalos,Unova,Sinnoh,Hoenn,Jhoto and Indigo losing in Orange only..but it has had a strange effect on him..as he won his very first championship here the Orange league and it would've made it 7-0 for him a clean sweep,but he doesn't like that particular thing,i taunted him so many times with that "cheat" thing he rhymed he only giggles but whenever i mention our final battle or 7-0 he just becomes very grave and doesn't like to hear that at all..i told him i don't hold anything against him as he knows,but he just..i guess it pains him still that he behaved to me like a monster..and no i only get to see the funny side of it now and later scolded and forced him to see so as well as i told that we shouldn't let any dark corners unturned,to which he did giggle oblige and he has forced me not to mention battling again anytime soon..i just guess somehow he felt a circle has been completed and wishes to rest..and he needs it for sure,i've travelled him him now for an year and can see his exhaustion..but i'm having so much fun now being with Ash here that i don't want him to leave either..he has become a person that i can barely believe..i'm really lucky to have him..really..:)..
i've got all of Ash's water types as well which has made this place all the more strong,and i've just about figured how Ash beat me 0-7 that day..none of my pokemon ever wanted to battle any of his and the whole thing was a well led plan by Ash..he let each of his pokemon to say that 'this fight is only to get your master back with ours as they're only doing it cause your master isn't paying our master enough attention of late like couples do after a catfight'..something like that..haha..he recored a buch of such messages in a chorus from all the different water pokemons that he had with a illegal device(which he got from Professor Oak) that converted this recording into a sound wavelength that humans could never even detect without sophisticated instruments and he connected this device with many amplifiers that he secretly planted around the gym,where he sneaked into at late night and  after using Butterfrees to make the helpers sleep,he didn't use pokemons at all so that there was no noise and nothing was heard upstairs and then he went out and again came back officially to challenge me-but he could do all this cause he bribed the Gym Guards with a Bulbasaur each from Professor Oak's lab,who are pretty indespensible if you want to control a water Gym while showing them who he was and the few of our letters during our first relationship that he kept at his home,making sure the guards just knew that he was here to help as my reputation none liked cause i changed so much and always was so depressed,the few pokemon guards that still didn't comply were managed by a hoard of Wisings,which he procured from Lance,the Elite 4 of Kanto..and used this device secretly with during the match.. 
this whole plan made all of my battling and gym pokemons confused as to whether this was a real battle or just fun and then also very wisely he chose only those which were familier to me and my pokemons and kept the winner a bit longer only to get the referee a bit agitated while he adjusted his device which infact had many different such pokemon chorus' similar to the ones that the battling ones were using to confuse my pokemons..and while the Pokemon would say those words aloud again to somehow get the attention of the other gym pokemons while Ash played his tricks and if the newcoming pokemon from me was unknown to Ash's the Gym pokemon's behaviour will confuse it just that bit..amusing mind game Ash Ketchum..and you knew i was out of my mind with anger and despondency to notice all or any of this..you should apply for a job in Team Rocket Ash,yup,thats what would fit you the most..haha..but as i fainted screeming 'Golduck',Golduck just panicked and shouted help to all at the gym and going overboard..Ash did expect Golduck to obey me the most and that i'll choose him the last because he was informed by my sisters may be that i'm practising psychic powers with pokemons to forget my sorrow and thus may actually end up being a mental wreck beyond repair..
Ash deduced that Psyduck being my first and a very powerfull one i would choose it..well Starmie was actually the first but Golduck was much stronger..then Pikachu who travelled for such a long time with Pshyduck all those years ago during his initial stages,just told Golduck 'hey are you out of your mind bro? this is like a family drama we're just role playing' or something like that i guess but it was me who managed to frighten Golduck more than Pikachu and Ash's trash talking would confuse him..Ash barely managed us from getting killed..once again as we got togather,we surely are not a normal couple far from it..:)..Ash says he somehow thought Golduck might be a little difficult to handle in case i faint or something out of mental pressure..and all his trash talks were perfectly prepared and timed and as i told him in return of his brash statemnts only that i didn't want to see him again he just inferred i still may have feelings for him as he heard from my sisters back home and got confirmed as i didn't tell him that i can announce too in public that someone was the reason for my mental condition while specifying his name which in fact was what he expected and thought of retorting with the official breakup and cheating thing..but i just virtually told him that he still gives me mental pain and he realized i was still wanting to reconcile with him somehow,really he just gauged me inside out..:)..unfair Ash Ketchum,very unfair again..:)..i made him to see the funny side of it and but he still is rather dissapointed as he really was playing with my nerves,which were really stressed out already and he knew it..but he had to take care of so many things..as 1.i could've fallen inside the pool for which he took Ganger and Squirtel so that he could directly confront Golduck while trying to save me though Pikachu then wouldn't have been able to electrify the pool that quickly and some pokemons could've emerged from underwater by breaking the underwater barriers,which Ash thought of confronting with the pokemons he had used in his battle but they would've been weak so in the end he just told Squirtel to throw my body up and and prepared Charizard-Bulbasaur combination to get me out,Charizard as he could evaporate water and fly away very quickly,though if he tried to break through the walls or roof it was all on Bulbasaur to protect me somehow,which was a responsibility that needed inch perfect precision and Bulbasaur was the only one who Charizard trusted on his back except Ash himself if they were alone..if my helpers did something or the pokemons did create a bigger issue Ash said he would've released his Taurose herd to have a head on collision with the charging rescue party approaching the exact spot..and he said he only had to pick those who knew me intimately so that they'll give their all to protect me,and Ash recored another pokemon chorus to say "please keep calm,your master is only being rescued,if you panick your master may be harmed more" but he had only one small amplifier so he wasn't sure how much of help that would've been..and there were so many other things that could've gone wrong..i said what if i didn't faint or simply won,he said we would've had to make you so then somehow and then said he was pretty confident of winning..when i forced him in this matter that there were just too many risks and factors to handle,he just stopped me saying all that matters is that we're alive-which is pretty true indeed..
Ash just told me that he always thought we just couldn't give up on each other that easily without atleast a nerve wrecking showdown..when you've known someone from the age age of 12,i just realize that our separation as well was only fun and game..:)..but i do understand why he is always a bit dissapointed with that event..
he got away with those devices simply by apprizing Lance,who was concerned about my well being and the gym as well and Ash then told him all our past and got the help,his travels to and fro was managed by Charizard,who has left me dizzy as he took me alone from here to Pettlesburg to meet May so quickly that i barely managed it..i'm not riding on you again Charizard and neither is Ash its too dangerous..and the culprit says he had travelled in such a manner many times in Kalos and once even did Kalos to Hoenn and back as means to see how quick Charizard could travel..Ash had Charizard many times during Kalos.. and i suspect the ring he gave me also was fetched from Cerulian in this manner which he said was what he only got at Pallet as it came here and he never told anyone about the Kalos-Hoenn-Kalos trip in a C-level record time for a Charizard with a human rider(C is the race level,there are many races where Charizard and their trainers participate but thats a whole different thing and among A to H is the level depending on speed and altitude,the first 4 are strictly for professionals and a normal trainer shouldn't fly at D level..and this guy created a record at C in a private and utter recklace attempt)..and the idiot grinned that as they managed to beat the previous record just by a whisker and planned to do Kalos-Pallet-Kalos via the longest root in record time as well but backed off as Liza many times severely reprimanded him for trying to match professional racers so he had to back off else Charizard would've got into trouble..and he never used any protection and didn't tell anyone what he was doing and his Kalos group being like his admirers never quizzed him much either..stupid idiot,you're not getting to do that ever again and it's funny how he and Charizard both thinks its not at all unsafe and thats why he even let me try it but atleast i had Bulbasaur with me as well as Garrydos and Ganger-Haunter-Gastling combination were there as well so i was atleast using safety..otherwise i would've been killed as we flew at a very high C level as well..Charizard though wont allow anyone else on his back alone while he's going at that speed expect Ash,Bulbasaur and me,as other pokemons dont give him "respect" which he asserts is his real food,respect meaning the major portion of their drinks and persons as they are 'too heavy or light' which is the proper amount of drink that he's given compared to other pokemons after the job is over..some pokemon this is..and while i scoffed that Charla wouldn't be so moody,he flamethrowed me which is "don't get her into this,she never paid attention,when we learnt how to manage our tail flame if we fell into the sea,always fooling around with a bunch of blokes i will crush if i see them around anywhere"...haha..Charizard is Charizard..Baulbasaur simply shrugged me off saying nothing would've happened as did the ghost pokemons and strangely Garrydos too,saying we got your back don't bother..Pikachu wasn't with me although he as usual poked his nose in it and said it's Baulbasaur's fault that he doesn't whip Charizard which made Charizard and Bulbasaur turn on him but the Ghost pokemons made all of them laugh it out in the end,though while questioned on how he himself did that Ash had to hold onto Bulbasaur with both his hands to maintain balance,PikaPi just said he would get into Ash's jacket to make sure if they ever went faster than his liking he'll caution them whith a good bolt,but strangely i learnt Pikachu is always dissapointed that they didn't fly fast enough cause Charizard wasn't whipped properly else they could've been much quicker-and we scantly avoided another round of infighting..a crazy bunch really..i'll take you to an illegal sea-dive Ash then you'll see how happy you are while you get a good many meters underwater without proper protection..idiot..but as I said i did illegal sea-dives for which i myself was reprimanded severely and Ash also doesn't like diving at all just like i don't like flying at a high pace at an high altitude where Charizard took me...so we'll bicker about these along with our pokemons here as well..Pikachu is the very partial mediator now among any set of opponent in the whole gym including helpers and guards..he has an opinion for everyone and now he has become extremely moody and spends more time with me than Ash which is a huge victory for me..take that Ashey-boy..:)..life is really full of joy here at the Gym,which i ever dreamt before..its just amusing that i'm living my dream here..
but Ash sitting in the stand while i fight against challengers is something that i feel a bit strange about,cause it was always the other way around before most times..but he doesn't cheer for me at all,which i always find precious to torment him about..:).. he's just observing and later passing on his opinions in training and to the challenger..this makes things so much better for the challengers as they can relate to Ash more easily..he is though very reluctant to fill in but certainly does when i don't feel like battling or can't..and as usual he doesn't have a clue how to use only one type of pokemon one after another-still..:)..though i don't know how he manages..neither does he,but that's my Ash..:)..nobody has really got a grip even in all these years so as to how he gets things done with some unimaginable moves..but he'll always be a million miles behind me in swimming pool which is an eternal advantage in training and playing with all the pokemons..:)..i know what our secret is both he and me..we're just too intuitive sensitive caring and stubborn-thats all..its always difficult to manage things for such people talk about Battles or personal life..
