Inside Misty's Mind Part 1 :

Inside Misty's mind :

(the recently crowned Kanto Pokemon Master Ash Ketchum wishes to challenge you)..this is what i could hear in my dreams..rather nightmares as i had those everyday for an year or so..but this name and his demands simply got me out of myself..all these times for an year and half i'm trying to forget him so hard leading me to the brink of mental breakdown...damn it..i'll show you,you egotistical ...
(towards battlefield)
Ash Ketchum..Pokemon Master..nah! whats up with me? i don't care for a person who caused me so much pain over the last 18 months,whoose memory nothing can make me forget,nor my psychic adventures nor books nor all my gym battles-nothing...i seriously will break down mentally after today's match,but i must try to keep keep the honour of this Gym that some random bloke breaks in and gets to do whatever he wants because he's a Pokemon Master..i know he's trash talking only to play with my already out of control nerves..till i go insane..how could anyone have this audacity?..halt it might be a trick...to do what?he wants to beat me and then introduce me to his latest girlfriend and trophies and then thank me for the early days and memories and just leave with a smug look that i was never a match for him?..no i can't take it anymore,he's not going out of this place without being humiliated..
(upon arrival)
Ash Ketchum...i haven't seen him in the last two years except those papers that you get foisted on your face..he looks very calm from outside though..whats he's up to?..this is surely a man with great determination and composure i've never seen except in Elite 4..nah!what are you thinking Misty,he's here to put the final knail in your coffin...i must get ready..but..well we did break up didn't we,so if i told the press without naming you and defamed you? only if i reminded him that before i accepted,but then again my reputation won't help me either that i've become a mental wreck and spitting out anything?..i'm really backed to a corner..just battle..win or lose i'll go to a mental asylum after this one as anyhow he'll humiliate me more and i won't be able to take it anymore..MISTY!...BATTLE...
