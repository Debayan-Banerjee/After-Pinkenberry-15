Inside Misty's Mind Part 2 :

(during Golduck vs Pikachu)
pikachu?!?..even you PikaPi?..you never battled me ever before and i didn't imagine you to emerge last..for some reason i thought you didn't come with him today as i didn't notice you..and you agreed to get into a ball?..to remind me if you did so in the first place i would have never met Ash?..but you will take his side no matter whether you liked it or not won't you?..i can't take it anymore..
but why is Pikachu looking at me like as if pleading with me..he'll always be with Ash..it hurts me out of bounds that i am being cheated by Ash in a battle by means of Pikachu of all Pokemons..my PikaPi,which infact are his words for 'Misty'..
(Ash says i'm returning the favour only,you're the one who cheated first)
i can't think..i just don't have any strenght to keep standing anymore..Ash Ketchum,Ash Ketchum-my once most cherished dream..now..now just has taken away the light out of my head..first he shows he's way better than me at my very own game being able to beat me 0-7 in the 7 so far and finally cheating as if to get himself disqualified on purpose so that i get to save my face...and then..i can't believe you would ever say that Ash..ever..i cheated right?..i cheated and you were just enjoying yourself,i broke up and you were just being a little moody that day,i was the one to date anyone that would appear at the door while you were only being good friends,i was jealous of your success,i was holding you back while cheating on you and feiging that i care for you while you were being the definition of innocence,i only broke up cause i was unable to hide the fact anymore that i was indeed cheating on you..cheating,cheating,always cheating since i first met you..i'm going insane now...GOLDUCK... 
(after waking up at hospital and talking with Daisy)
i don't know how i've still stayed sane...and even managed to sob only a little...and that i don't feel a grip of the everpresent darkness that i've had since i broke up with him.. 
i got beaten with water pokemons at my own gym 0-7 before being utterly humiliated if the previous result wasn't enough...no Ash didn't cheat in any of those 7 but simply showed he was way way better...
i should just move in near her or Lillie and do get way from the Gym now that he showed i'm just not in his league at all in my own gym in my own game...i know how Ash got me all riled up waking me up after 1 hour of sleep and i just got played all into his hands,he has killed me entirely..but Tracy and Gary..well doesn't matter Violet is busy and any or all of those will now have to either return to the Gym or sell it out..irony isn't it sis?you had to drag me here forcing to depart my journey all those years ago and now you'll be dragged back..i surely am not going back..but it pains me to be in Pallet..no i should've just stayed in Orange or anywhere..Ash,why don't you just leave me alone?..the Gym was my last hope and you humiliated me there as well..i just don't want to know what's happening with you and don't want you to interfare in my life that's all...is that too much to ask for,Ash?...do i have to bow down to your girlfriends and admit that it was all my fault that i ever liked you in the first place or as you accused me then that i cheated on you?...
(Upon seeing Ash)
why is he here?WHY IN THE WORLD IS HE HERE?...this man now would go on a sentimental spree to coax me into another trap and i again will get a nerve rackage..i can't stay awake anymore..
(after talking with friends and family)
No..i woke up with tears in my eyes,surely i shouldn't have been this rude to Brock and Tracy throughout..i was blind..they didn't do any harm to me..but i just didn't want to see them to forget my times with Ash..that name hasn't left me since i first heard it..won't it ever leave me?..but i guess it's my fault..i should've moved on with some guy..there were a few who did have good concern for me..but i just,no i guess i just can't forget Ash still even after yesterday...
(after meeting Pikachu)
atleast his pokemon hasn't forgotten me..i don't think Pikachu of all will really repeat whatever he told him..he has to stay with him no matter what so what would he gain in either case? or Ash Ketchum would you leave your Pikachu too some day like you did with me?didn't you tell me i meant as much to you as did Pikachu if not more all those years ago?can you throw him away as easily as you did with me?...Pikachu only told me to give him a chance,well lets see..and i thought Gary implied it too..though i wasn't nice to him exactly..
(after damnding Kalos Friends)
i must know what Ash was doing in Kalos..only then may be i'll see him again..all those days trying to practise psychic powers with Golduck didn't really help my nerves i guess..otherwise why would i lose 0-7 in an emotional challenge..still that name along with Ash haunts me and Golduck probably didn't want to fight him either..why would he?..he knows Ash for years..its strange how Pokemon can understand human emotions and refuses to fight people they once thought were very close to,if only they knew the real motives..lets see what happens..
(After talking with Cilan)
i never met Cilan in person before unlike Iris but we've spoken a few times before but not much in the later parts as My relationship with Ash soured in the later parts,who was infact too oblivious then to think about Ash's personal life as she many times told me Ash just either trains or studies battle strategies or goes to party..well Cilan is a guy as direct as you can get..just said that Ash was not doing the right things in his personal life at Unova but his concern and care for his Pokemons and Battles were only getting ever better..nothing could affect Ash when he was with his Pokemon and Cilan thought he saw only an ever exuberent child whenever Ash was with his Pokemon..child..if only you knew the 12 year old Ash i knew so well-that's just battle and pokemon..i was foolish if i ever thought he'll grow up and mature..when he did just went away from me..Cilan though did say that he never found Ash enjoying anybody's company more than his pokemon's..and it only increased as he got further and further away from me..thanks for help Cilan..

(after meeting Serena)

so basically he's trying to show me that he has always been very firm..and that picture of someone kissing him in public while he held her hand didn't mean he also gave into the craze surrounding him..and probably he let people to fondle with him more than he should've..i do realize how many people wanted our attention in sensational four days..Serena seems to be a very sweet girl indeed..and i perfectly understand her emotions of dreaming about somebody for many years...atleast she got a proper clarification and i guess she has a conviction about Ash..is it possible that he has also realized his mistakes at Kalos?..Serena affirmed as did Cilan that Ash became very interested in and Mental side of pokemon battles since later parts of Unova and in Kalos he would hike less and be in the cities or towns rather and study many things go to libraries or just go alone somewhere for some times or to researchers,doctors and all,while he has learnt to cook and all the things you need from Cilan,he has become a matured man indeed as it would seem but as Serena said he has also become a bit elusive going through psychological pokemon battle books and all research articles night after night yet managing to stay as fresh as ever and his behaviour is extremely caring as they would say but Serena said now she understand his warmth to anyone isn't that of a person whoose just enjoying himself hanging around rather like a support as if Ash himself was fulfilled enough to support many people and he was very firm about himself and certail issues,infact Gary said this as well that Ash has become worlds apart in the last two years,the few times he was interviewd he just strangely brushed them aside with some abstruce talks and strange looks but his handling of pokemon has gone to a different level as he managed to win Kalos as a all time record never losing a single Pokemon in all his 9 matches including the final,which is a record there..but what did he mean that he already has someone?..he would be utterly immature to think he'll ever be back with me again cause i wont just after all that he caused me to go through..and Serena said all he only ever told her on being quizzed over his intellectual pursuits was that change was required urgently..Professor Oak also did speak with me before Serena came and he said Ash has become indeed a very thoughtful person,but he thinks its a very good change and he has never felt Ash to be so warm yet content in his life and it's pretty hard to understand what's going through his mind anytime which was the most obvious thing about him before but his fear is that Ash isn't cheerful anymore at all rather being a bit dejected all times not exactly knowing whether to appreciate his own achievements or not..
i don't know why but this loss to Ash has got rid of my mental burden..i didn't need to be obsessed with the Gym and all this just to get away from his memories..but then again its not that i didn't try..but i couldn't..
(meeting Ash)
all these words and no matter what he's still at bay with his words over emotional matter when it comes to precision..i'm dizzy really...
i could sense an extremely firm sincierity in Ash,which is strange to be honest but fits with what i've heard about him,which strangely has pre occupied my mind since i got back my consciousness days ago the second time..i can't shed his thoughts and wanted to know more and more about him..
but i never heard this voice ever from him..but i don't believe him..he also gave his phone to me to check if he ever called me after breakup-which i did and did find to be true,though he never gave this personal contact to me as he says he got just it before Kalos and changed his number as did i after the breakup..but its been two years and each of his words were pretty genuine it seemed as i did see hints of emotion in him but it never really became apparent..unless..but again all this can't be a set up to cajole me into something,he has everything and to be honest he if he wants can easily get into Elite 4 and can be in a relationship with anybody-he doesn't have to be infatuated with me,he can't drag me with him all he wanted..but he has become a man of firm conviction?.."finallyto sum up,i don't care for your certificate,i know what i'm,all i want to tell you is that i've never given into immorality in my life-thats my final word to you on my side and i'm hoping to hear from you as well and if you decline don't think that i'll give up trying anythime soon"..strong,stronger than the Sinnoh title win that i saw where he won the title from a position nobody anywhere has ever won which i was in 7-0 down his last Pokemon Pikachu had to beat 8 pokemons and Pikachu was already changed once,a ghost type 2 grass 1 ground 2 fire a water and finally a psychic with only 3 in his advantage being grass and water and rest 5 all against him..Pikachu wasn't fresh and already failed to beat the water type which was his biggest advantage..1 against 8-to a guy who also was from Sinnoh,local support was all against Ash..and he won.."a Psychic has to see you,Ghosts must concern you,a Rock always thinks of strength as last resort,you have to bully if you've the type advantage and grass types have too many attacks which can exhaust them quickly,but most of all luck has to favour"..this is what would Ash say afterwards giggling at his astonished friends there and here at the video conference we had from Oak lab and Cerulian Gym..
"and i dedicate this to lets see...um..those whom i haven't yet.."(here actually you can get an extra official replica of the trophy,if the winner wants..Ash got one for me from Battle Frontier before)
Dawn->"i'll..give you the Wallace cup!just gimme the damn trophy or else.."
Tracy->"Ahem!let me object,in Orange.."
Brock->"Oh shut up Trace! i've been with him for ages"
Tracy->"and Professor.."
Brock->"don't.say.that.name..."
Daisy->"i also deserve something Mr Ketchum if you want that Battle Frontier trophy to remain intact"..
Tracy->"Ash,wasn't that the one which we managed to glue togather after both the handles came off?"
Me->"what did you just say Trace?..you broke my troph..oops.."
Dawn->"so she already has one,its mine,mine,mine..Piplupsnatch that thing away"
Brock->"hey!no way Piplup,i want that,it's mine"
Professor Oak->"Tracy this is very irresponsible from you that you'll break it on the way"
Tracy->"um..uh..no professor!no no its not true.."
"huh,again a disagreement!i'll give it to Professor Oak then if only someone declines a double treat"
Brock->"..sigh..sadly,she wont"
Daisy->"yes!" 
Tracy->"Daisy wins..again..unfair absolutely..unfair.."
and we all brust into laughter...
good old days..still makes me smile..that Ash and this one..sigh..
and may be that was what made him so cocky in Unova..but how can a man without all those qualities get a Pokemon Master title and keep winning leagues no matter what was in his mind..anyhow i'll tell him my side as well..how he has caused me so much pain from basically the first day..all of it..Ash Ketchum has left me high and dry for all these 13 years..it must come to an end..may be even i can then finally be able to forget him..which i must i have my whole life lfet to live..i really should've been more frank to him when we broke up two years back..
(after telling ash about her side)
..ah!finally..i do feel very light now..i guess i won't have the nightmares anymore..but i'll still keep this sketch from Orange..i guess only because i wont be travelling again like that..really after all these years i guess i can't forget how happy i was then..but i don't know whether i'll be ever back to that sort of happiness again..*sigh*..if only..anyhow i can't think anymore..

(after Ash leaves with an invitation to Pallet)

Ash,why are you torturing me for 13 years,everyday,still?..he was definitely sincire that day but again just sold me a bait by inviting..this boy is playing with my emotions for so many years,i'm tired very tired..

Ash you may think that it has been more difficult for you than me but i'm just not in the mood of all that sweet talk again and again,okay? just after few days of that nightmare at this very Gym just downstairs...i'll take years as you did yourself Ash,deal with it..then i can still reject you after keeping you hanging for two years if you still hope i'll come back to you..you'll move around hopelessly in hope and then get to see what heartbreak you have...but,i really can't do that..it breaks me down even to think of the pain that i went through because of Ash and besides i'll have to be dishonest with myself the most as well then,which i won't be able to be..ever..well,i'm just too stressed out..i'll think later...

(3 days later)

no i will go to Pallet with my sisters..and must talk with Ash..atleast it'll be a change,i'm getting choked up here in the Gym...i'm undecided still whether i should go back with him or not but i can't keep it suppressed anymore i guess..why did you call me a cheat,Ash?..i could tolerate it even when you said i held you back as it was a fact that you won every league you competed in since i left though i was there when you won Orange..but you never called me a cheat even while joking for i don't know 8 years or so no matter what..and you never did directly accuse me on infidelity till that moment..i just thought your actual spite againt me was that i was indeed cheating on you as i do know how overprotective you've always been about me even in Kanto...and so was i..but this really got upto my head as i've been tired of this word with so many rumours that i heard about me because simply i was a young and beautiful gym leader and with great skills and also in the sensational four..but if ever i felt that this guy is interesting i would always hear this word-"cheat"-in my head

my heart really was with you all the time and even when we broke up i still couldn't go out with anybody no matter how much i tried simply due to this word eventually forcing me to a lonely life from which i was actually trying to get out all my life..you shouldn't have said that word..i've been courted by innumerable people and never once could the press say anything or publish photoes of people kissing me as they did to you...i told you so many times in Unova don't get let this fame into your head..you never listened..i saw my own sisters living a high life despite their skills and grew tired of seeing them with with many guys whom they would just pick and choose at will...i'm so happy for them that they changed so much after their world tour had completed and i also only joined them then..and we always were so firm about this publicity...and i get to be called a cheat at that emotion situation..i didn't feel i would wake up sane after that...you've got your ways only because somehow i have...Ash,you should've never called me a cheat...




(in ash's home,night)
i guess i just couldn't help but to come here and stay up this long and i also didn't want to go over to my sister's house as something interesting happened here
..he has some sort of psychic hold over me that makes me to fall for him all the time..but..but,i just can't think of anyone else at all,never will be and never did..
..and,and neither could he...now,now i know that..:)
..yes i've got it..:)..
<Deep breath>..
Ash was the one to open the door first and seeing me just held my hands firmly..and his tearful face had an expression of joy which has made me follow him all these years and it did its magic again..i did break down instantly..then he just embraced me and whispering in my ears spacing the words down individually and slowly firmly said-
"i will cheat all i want as if only you/cheating loyal you're ever as i'm for you"..i was left dumbstruck to be honest for a few moments as he let me go as soon as he said that rhyme and handed me the same in a little piece of paper and just went away from the house on Charizard..and left me thinking all afternoon and evening..Mrs Ketchum greeted me warmly but was a bit reserved i guess she just doesn't know what to do..told me to sit down in the front room,where i was for a long time till Lillie came here and said if i wished i could stay here as she will be staying here tonight and Mrs Ketchum also agreed preparing the extra room and i even had dinner here..i have to stay cause i didn't get Ash at all..and i know he has never been good with words especially in sentimental matters and being what he is probably wants me to judge him by myself..he wrote in his message apart from the poem that if i wanted i could stay here tonight and see for myself all that i wanted and then judge me..i reached here around 4 in the afternoon..he did try to contact me many times but i changed my personal number so he didn't get me..Lillie said Gary would never mention Ash to her but if ever somehow his name came up and Lillie was about to give her opinions Gary would brush her aside simply saying the same thing he has been saying all the time since Unova.."Ash will understand his mistake,He's just not that type.",to which if Lillie tried to retort Gary would say "Let him win Kalos"..as if he just knew he'll win..but Lillie never realized why Gary was so confident on Ash and he would never mention anything further to avoid the situation from getting worse..Gary also seemed to be least concerned about me saying the same thing "she's not that type"..he's same as Ash..Lillie says thats the only thing she doesn't get about Gary,what he saw in Ash and me to be so damn confident about our relationship despite seeing that it fell apart...i've been trying to link this lyric with what Ash's behaviours..i myself love these kind lyrics and its meanings from my childhood and read much literature and pokemon psychology books myself..
and then i finally have got it..i can't believe the king of dense people Ash Ketchum could spit out a dense rhyme like that...what magic has Kalos done to you Ash?..i infact have just ended up laughing my head off while i've just finished my contemplation on the whole affair even in this situation waking Lillie up who was a little schocked but happy to see me laugh like this after a long long time..i know you since you're 12 Ash Ketchum..you didn't even know how to catch a pokemon when i first met you..you had no clue about anything..:)..and now you're a poet all of a sudden..no matter what i must visit Kalos myself as well...but i'm happy,i really am...i've just realized what you mean Ash Ketchum,you can't hide yourself from me no matter what..
..we're being right if only we're being with with each other no matter what we're being-loyal or cheats-whether we're with each other or someone else-we're just meant for each other in this life..and this is the last time i would doubt that and even think about that..:)..tomorrow we're getting officially back Ash Ketchum..:)..we never really did break up and so rather than being nice which i was when we first became a couple as a huge mistake from my part otherwise i'm damn sure you would've been kept not only grounded but way below ground level,this time i'll just eat your little head up,you'll see..:)..lyrics right?..you'll see epics tomorrow..:)..
it feels very very good...i guess i'm back to being 12 year old Misty again..:)..but i must catch a sleep and finally i'm sure to have a peacefull one..
