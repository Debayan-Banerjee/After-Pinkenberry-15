Inside Ash's Mind Part 2:

(15 minutes later)
i came early morning so that i could catch Misty off guard as i was informed she goes to sleep at 4 or 5 in the morning and now its 6 in the morning..Charizard was excellent..and I challenged Misty-i'll fight only with water types myself,if she loses,i get to decide who's the next Gym leader here would be as i then would be good enough to judge her and others as i get to beat her at her own game with water pokemons only,which infact even if i'm a Pokemon Master,against a Hall of Fame worthy Gym Leader of water pokemons,still an almost impossible-to-surmount disadvantage-but hey,that had been my position throughout my career
and i also said she has to step down immediately as i won't then deem her good enough and will make sure to distribute badges to whoever came eventually closing the Gym down completely and she has to move out and go wherever she wished but without any of her pokemons as i can improve them far more,in case she declined i said i'll continue to visit the Gym anytime i wanted and will deem her an absolute coward,which then i'll tell the news if they ask again about my relationship status and i'll do it without naming her..i can understand this trash talk will rile her up to maximum even if it made no sense..i just wanted to show her that she can't forget my memory and she has no place to live in immediately if she doesn't have Cerulian Gym as the alternate would be to either return to the fashion world or to Pallet Town of all places or to start a new family for herself immediately after being driven out of the Gym without any pokemon and now that'll not be exactly easy given her recent reputation here with an insinuation that she has to plead to get into the show business again to have any future..but above all the implication that i could train her own pokemons better than she ever has or will-this is the ultimate for any person with self respect..i want to show my ego even more to her as all my friends and family told me that Misty still hasn't forgotten me and that is exactly what troubles her..i just want to play a game with you Misty-where you're trapped trapped in a corner-you either will miraculously beat me or just break down entirely..Misty,i know how you're feeling but i want to take every opportunity to make you angry otherwise if i lose..no,that isn't an option today for me..being with team rocket all these years have taught me a few tricks and i'll use any and all today...
my name itself though did rile her up to begin with and she said if she won,may she never see me again in her life..which i also accepted,as it makes me more optimistic of succeeding today..her anger has forced her to immediate accept my challenge without any consideration..this is far before the Gym officially opens but if the Leader agrees the match must be played out...i said that i'm a Pokemon Master and not a random passerby i don't live a lazy Gym Leader life so i can't be dictated according to the official time and that those who can't battle anytime anyone challenged them like i do,i deem them to be utmost cowards...really i can't believe i've been this cruel and that to to a person of central importance in my life..
(after the battle,in the pokemon centre)
some novel i could write on what happened in the last two hours..Misty came at 6:10 and i was shocked to see her..she looked so gloomy and unwell..i barely managed to withold my tears and i could see her being extremely angry,though her face was veiled completely..but she didn't utter any words,straight went into the battle at exactly 6:15..we had to choose 8 without change and each winner couldn't carry on to the next round only being able to be used after all 8 has been exhausted and i had to choose first..it lasted about an hour before we both came to our final pokemon...the previous 7 went 0-7 in my favour we're both down to our final Pokemons before we reuse our previous winners..that is me only infact,which means her last pokemon has to beat all my eight alone to win..and as her final pokemon was Golduck on whom Misty's whole fate was depending in this battle who i don't know why was a bit hesitant to see me..i looked at Misty when i chose Pikachu and she shuddered a bit and then just screamed out that i'm cheating to which i retorted i was only returning the favour..i can still see Misty fainting immediately,Golduck going absolutely crazy and using all his attacks and summoning all the pokemons of the gym..a few pokemon braking glasses and charging at me,to which i'm using a hoard of Butterfrees my Charizard and Bulbasaur..sleep powder out of blue always worked..and Pikachu turning the whole pool and all surroundings in an electric lava so as to speak just to make sure none entered the pool and Golduck couldn't do anything and none also came up from underwater..to keep other pokemon's away from me..Golduck and Pikachu fainting,Misty's other pokemon's just about reaching me before having to oblige to the sleep powder and the electric shock..Bulbasaur just about being able to get Misty down from the 10 feet tall standing platform,on top of Charizard while both using other possible attacks to keep away other Pokemons and finally a huge explosion happening threating to throw me off my own standing platform just about when i managed to get on top of Charizard and Charizard having taken the full jolt of the explosion fainting as he tries his best to keep us safe and finally Bulbasaur fainting as well as we're just about to hit the ground after exhausting itself with a Solar beam finally taming the other Pokemons and i somehow managing to hit the ground on top of Charizard to avoid direct collison while protecting Misty's body from becoming a pulp by getting stamped under Charizard..
i somehow managed to save Misty from landing below Charizard's unconscious body and i somehow am miraculously not much injured with only my electric proof jacket having taken a full volt of electricity..Misty didn't suffer any serious hits either having been unconscious all the while..all this happened in a matter of few minutes so as to speak..
i told my name to the helpers while entering the gym first time early morning today,who were rather sympathetic as was the referee,whom i told before to sneak away just after my final Pokemon is released..and had she objected she would've been in an absolute mess now..
but no helpers were injured seriously and they rather helped me to carry the pokemon and Misty to the pokemon centre after the mayhem while taming the Pokemons..i guess they even more than me loathed to see her in that state either..i've informed all about my victory to the Oak Lab,they transmitted it to the right persons..surprizingly Violet was here at Cerulian today she is now with Misty..came here as soon as she heard it..the event has created a big commotion outside the Gym,which now has picked up a rather creepy name for itself..it has been quite a mayhem there early morning with pokemons trying to run wild and the blasts..i guess it suits my reputation of destroying buildings..i just want to go back to the Gym after writing a note for Violet on what went there...the pool water all evaporated and they had to exhaust their last bit of emergencies of all kinds to get things under control..
(Back at gym)
i've been back an hour ago without informing anyone..the public is still around but the helpers here have clearly explained that the challenger didn't cause the damage and nothing illegal happened either as the Gym leader herself accepted the challenge then fainted midmatch making her Pokemons lose their minds...and later Officer Jenny spoke with me..she understood my concern and has managed things very well..i've attended to all the pokemons here and somehow managed to calm them down a lot..my friends are at the pokemon centre and a few have also been in the Gym itself despite my repeated warnings..coming here without any aid infact helped to calm the pokemons down far easily as i thought it would..the portion of the gym where the actual main battlefield was situated and surrounding aquariums hasgot totally destroyed,but not much happened to the pokemons..now i've locked myself up now in Misty's room upstairs and told the police to guard the door...public are pretty interested especially with this place's reputation of late and my bad name..i don't want anyone to disturb me now and i'm very firm on this...
(evening,at gym)
yes all the trubles are now behind me..i'm at a far corner here in the Gym..i don't want to meet Misty before tomorrow and i plan to meet her exactly at the time when we started our match today...she is being treated,but she is alright..just had a shock..the Gym repairing work has started and would take a few days to finish the aquariums are already readjusted on an emergency basis to make sure the pokemons don't create any further trouble..
(night at Misty's room)
this room has been a mess...all her dear things i've been able to see...she lost her mind i guess and yes she was trying to practise psychic powers so that she could forget about us by her psychic pokemon especially Golduck...but it has made me realize how pure hearted a person Misty is..she really couldn't succeed..she still looked after her pokemon,her helpers weren't at all unsatified with her behaviour though they say she always demanded privacy,she thought of going out with a few guys but backtracked even before the first occasion i guess..it's just that she could never forget me..she still had a sketch of us from orange,gifted by Tracy-we two-giggling at each other..kept it under her pillow which is where i've left it..will only take it tomorrow..i've told Tracy and Daisy to stay at the pokemon centre in case she does something unwanted..i really understood what was going through her in all this time...poor Misty..ever so simple and straight..just fell for the first little kid she accidentally bumped into..always had feelings but the boy won't quite understand them and when he did it was time for her to leave..then was in cloud nine when the boy finally confessed his feelings for her and was absolutely heartbroken when she believed that the boy is not loyal anymore...yet just couldn't forget the boy whom she wished to be with since 12..her temper peopel say has always been a bit too short but anyone would like it so much once they knew her,that temper they say hasn't been shown in the last one year rather being replaced by an ever despondant voice in case of agitation..her face was very pale when i put her unconscious body up in my arms to the pokemon centre..it really was an expression of deep rooted dejection and innocence...no my thoughts are really clouting up...need to sleep a bit..a sleep powder would again save the day for me i guess..
(next morning on the way to pokemon centre)
yes finally going to see Misty...i heard she did speak with Daisy yesterday and was pretty normal..cried a bit,which Daisy said was good as she didn't show any of it of late..she expressed the desire to move in near Tracy and Daisy but still firmly refused to see Tracy...lets see what i can do..
