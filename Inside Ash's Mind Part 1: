Inside Ash's Mind Part 1:

inside Ash's Mind :

<Deep Breath...>Right,Finally I win Kalos Championship to make it 5 in a row with Hoenn,Battle Frontier,Sinnoh,Unova and this ! and this along with my Orange League,makes me elligible for the title of Pokemon Master...provided i can defeat the elite 4 in the within the next 12 months to keep it..bah..
It took me 13 years to accomplish this,13 long YEARS!
travelling across 7 regions,so many adventures,tears,joy,sweat,blood,success,failure,happiness,sorrow---so many my buddies-from my stubborn-turned-best-buddy PIKACHU to all that i caught,rather made friends with later..so many great friends and rivals i made..so many leagues,battles,upsets,victories and i've finally done it! its a hard job to achieve as well i guess as you have to get atleast 6 out of 8 championships that are played out throught all 7 regions..Battle Frontier is actually a corporation meaning there's a battle frontier title in each individual regions except Orange which is a smaller region thus it's league system is a bit different from the others...one has to win 6 out of 8 atleast within the age of 27 to be called initially a Pokemon Master and if they want their name to be in the Pokemon Trainer's Hall of Fame they then will have to defeat the Elite 4 heads in all 7 main regions within the next 12 months where you have to beat atleast 6 of them..easy job ain't it?..:)..if you get yourself in the Hall of Fame,you'll be able to get a permanent position in your regional Pokemon Leagues and Contests meaning you can retire at the age of 28 with nothing to do or bother about at all..crazy stuff..:)..you may enter Elite 4 as well but that will mean you have a very tough set of responsibilities and would basically be away from your family all the time and you can't quit it before atleast you complete 12 years once you accept..or you can yourself run a local contest or competition like Whirl cup at your liesure..or just do whatever the you wish but you're
1.not allowed to run a Gym or a Frontier Symbol as its head
and
2.not allowed to re enter in any competitions ever in life including pokemon contests..

now in case you don't compete in this Elite 4 Challenge you have to relinquish your title within three months and then you can do anything you want no restrictions apply except that you can't re enter any competitions again including contests..
and there are infinitely many rules which i've had to go through in all this 3 weeks since i landed in Kanto from Kalos..i delayed my home return as i had many things to learn afterwards..i can only get to see now that why so few people are there in Elite 4 etc..it's really guelling..man i guess i had the aptitude for anything else or built it up or had a gym or had a family business..basically in your best years all you do is to travel around madly..no permanent home,a possibility of settlementn till much late twentees..i wish i had chosen contests as they get a hell lot better treatment and can enjoy life..no luck for us..this isn't fair really..but i guess i was a bit too zealous..always going away the very next day or two after i returned home..no wonder i didn't develop any other skills except battling untill much later and only in Kalos where i got to look after myself and my friends who looked upto myself in literally everything..they were irritating but i just enjoyed with them and have made me finally a fully grown man..:)..thanks Kalos..

i started at the age of 12 still without any clue of any sort on anything i guess except my desire and enthusiasm!and truely i can't get a hold of my tears at this moment!nor can Pikachu.. :) !..because with all that i had to endure my dream is fulfilled finally even if i don't get into Elite 4 challenge,i still know that i've been conferred this title of Pokemon Master for which i and my family and close circle had to endure so much..
i'm now on the last 6 miles to pallet town and this is the same Viridian forest where it all began..gush..its been 13 years and seems like 13 hours! just can't wait to reach home and finally say my travelling is done now,Mom..:)..
..and i need to now plan for the next chapter of my life..settle down..this reminds me so much of May's words from all those years ago "you've got enough number of Taurose to open your own farm",maybe thats what i'll do i guess..haha..guess it's not anymore that adventurous at 25..really i wish i could go back to my 12 year old self again..nah..guess that's how the wheel turns i don't have that urge now i have to now focus on the bigger part thats left of my life...
i'm in a nostalgic mood really now...and just don't know how to feel now that i've travelled virtually the whole world continuously..i've made a name for myself i guess..but the only assurance now i guess is that surely it wont be again here in this very forest that i'll be challenged and be intensely involved in a Metapod vs Metapod meelee..haha..good ol' days..
Ah..why don't i take a bit of rest before the last few miles..just sit down and breath it all in..once i enter the town some random folks may still crowd me up..sigh..don't understand all this frenzy that initially comes with fame..so efemeral all this success and its repercussions..
What Ash Ketchum..have you become a philosopher or something?..just sit down take a breath..
(4.5 miles away,resting)
Ah! this tree is so soothing the gentle breeze in todays's warm forenoon..don't wanna sleep but just enjoy this place...
and think about what to do in future..i'm Ash Ketchum- a man of actions and instincts and sixth sense(only while battling..haha..)..don't think i'll be able to contemplate rather lazily for a long time doing nothing at home..have probably half an hour to an hour here and think it of right now before i start for my last lap till home..besides as much i think,settling down won't be that easy i guess..sigh..
i've made so many friends along the way-Tracy is still at Professor's lab and as sweet as ever,i guess he'll sketch his opponent in a boxing match rather even if his life was at stake..sweet sweet Trace,always such a good punching bag for both me and Mist at Orange..nah not about her now..no..later..
..Brock is a fully licensed doctor now,i can't believe myself how that ever optimistic romantic have all grown up and is in a relationship even now,though strangely he refuses to give me her name..i'll pull your ears out of your face if you don't introduce us this time Brocko...Gary-well he's my best confidence now i guess..surprize,surprize-will make it i guess even a bigger that Professor Oak..talk of family heritage-but still a bit cocky..*hugs*..he has become a very caring and gentle person now..and it has simply spilled out at our relation making it evergreen and beautiful..i really do have a great friend in him..
May is doing great but she seems to go pretty slow about travelling around,i guess she's just all the more matured than i ever was at her age and values other things as well,now in Orange..she'll be established i guess after that,with Drew..hehe! no they make an amusing team..and Drew is a wonderful person now very sweet and brilliant..but i still haven't got a grip on how could Drew have been that cocky while Hoenn was his very First region itself,he seemed like an all knowing..nah,i guess i was a bit like that too..not a bit but even more..haha..but surely unlike Paul-he's doing great though,Paul now and is so much changed,besides i beat him in the semifinals just weeks ago..great battle Paul..thanks for pushing me..all the best wishes..but Paul said this was his last and travel and he'll return to Sinnoh now and get a permanent way to settle down..he also has tired himself out and don't want to move around anymore..he matches me is this aspect though..best of luck man,you do deserve all the best..
Dawn also is doing astonishingly well..as confident as she is,i really hope wins don't get to her head though..nah her mom will take care of that..AND be confident Dawn always but just don't take you foot off the wheel,she is also going a bit slow after like May..man were i and Paul the only ones to travel around madly?..even Max doesn't do it..Max is amusing as well for his age..still a hopeless nerd though..haha..*hugs*..hethough as everyone would have it wants to be something other than a trainer-but thats being a pokemon breeder and after only travelling through Hoenn again he has decided on it..all the best little one..
Iris has become more naive in these days i hear and almost at the end of Jhoto but her skills are developing in manifolds..good luck and all the best..Cilan..i seriously wished he and Brock would cook for me all life long..*hugs*..best wishes buddy..
and I've just parted with Clemont and Bonnie..great friends,great people,gret little kids..haha..all the best for your bright future..and that Serena..haha..what does she takes me to be ?Saviour of masses?..crazy little girl..i do hope the best very best for her..and hope she gets someone who'll look after her..she can be too innocent at times..like she tried to kiss me while finally departing..man,that was gross and especially so because i've had enough with these stunts during my days with news reports..grow up girl,you might come to regret things unless you mature quick enough for your age...but apart from this severe foolishness she is also a very sweet and caring person but irritated me the most always saying i was her goal and literally taking notes while i battled..she is one little fangirl..actually she is in dreams as she was 4 and i was 10 when she was at Kanto around our place and i somehow i guess rescued her in her view..so she is still in dreamland..i invited her myself to come along if she so wished as i could recognize her and her parents when i met them in Kalos..they are actually very close to Oak family..Serena unfortunately was still undecided on what to to in life and so i decided to take her under my wing so she could learn something..that's the beginning of my babysitting..haha..
Ritchie i remember..a great friend..i wish we travelled togather at some point of time,he's doing great,we ocassionally contact..and i thank Liza all the time for making my Charizard such a legend,she is among my gym leader friends though actually i should call them teachers..:)..and..i can just go on and on but there's so many i really need to thank..without them and my Mom(luv you mom,just a few hours,and i won't be leaving tomorrow..:)..) i would still have been stuck in this very forest even after 13 years..hehe..
But...nah lets not bring that up here..besides she must be busy like i've been all these years..never realized her position and responsibilities before though,really was i this immature even during Unova?..well winning Unova and then meeting Serena Bonnie and Clemont really made me grow up mentally so much..besides i was the oldest by far and had to babysit them..haha..But still..there's something in me that's pulling me to a certain place where i bumped into her accidentally..you Misty,of all people..there's another that's trying to drag me back to the place where we parted ways..and finally there's another which tries to say..
"what makes me Misty most of all/in our final curtain call/is that i'll never see you..again.."
..Misty..
no as much joy as that would bring me once,now it's rather the opposite..long story though..sigh..how could my mood swing from cloud nine to this mess in moments...but,
"will i ever see you again,Ash?"
"sure Misty,i promise."
but haven't i kept it?..we more than saw each other many times after that till that day...
"why don't you call me anymore?"
"we are calling.."
"you've changed too much Ash,i guess you're the one now a days as reports say enjoying youself"
"look,i travel around and have won a few regional titles ok-fame is eventual-i don't just sit in a Gym waiting for some random guy.."
"What did you say?i sit here and wait for random guys and your the one who roams around with cheerleaders.."
"enough said,please i'm just not in the right state of mind ok?just lost.."
"or you think because i'm now part of the 'sensational sisters' i'm always in heaven?"
"i didn't mean it okay.."
"is that an appology or an excuse?"
"look,i just want to..hellow..hellow..<sorry but this number can't be reached at this moment>..damn it go to hell."
...sigh... that was really the beginning...why didn't i just say 'i am sorry,Mist'?..i of all people perfectly knew how delicate and sensisitive she is,or rather was..sigh..it was such a wonderfull moment when we finally summed up the courage to confess our feelings after Battle Frontier and then throughout Battle Frontier and most of Sinnoh it was so good..
..no i don't want to go into details..she just thought i wasn't loyal to her anymore now that i was famous..and yes i didn't do the right things after i won Unova and throughout Unova i really was too much into my training and basking in the attention from my Sinnoh victory,3rd in the row..no,i didn't go around with cheerleaders at all but i probably could've turned down a few places,parties with reporters and all that..they would link me with anyone they wished and there weren't any lack of girls after Sinnoh more so,of all people Brock did warn me about it because i was from a little town and never seen anything like this before and that i was too friendly with unnecessary people,Professor Oak too told me then to watch out the fame,but i just brushed them aside as i guess my ego was a bit to wild then and i deep down always have known that all i need to do is to be with my pokemon at the end to win..but Misty..the Great Cerulian Gym Leader,with a real mean streak..a Sensational Sister known throughout Kanto..whenever she spoke with me,she was still the same little girl that used to scream her head off at my every step all the time just to make sure i meticulously obey all her advises or orders rather of all kinds..i guess i also doubted her sincierity now that she was famous even though she didn't show any of that during conversations rather it was me always who grew her tired of showboating and battle talks..but,that everpresent shrill of her's-so loathed and craved,the one central thing that really made my bond with her,her real token of feelings for me-i guess won't ever come back in my life again..*sigh*..i wish she was with me in Unova...she actually never shouted at me since we parted ways after jhoto..till our arguments much later and she was always so nice and never tried to upset me at all now that i was away from her..sigh..
it did become hard to keep contacts in Unova for both me and her due to our schedules as zbrock left as well...i guess i should've been more matured in Unova..3 consecutive titles got upto my head..Iris and Cilan couldn't do much they didn't know me that well,still did their best..
but then as we parted ways shortly after i won the Unova Title and came back home-around two years now,since then i guess i'm worlds apart as a person..but she would just refuse to talk,refuse to keep contacts with any of our mutual friends..and i know how brock and tracy felt about that,she was so so dear to them-the ever petulant sister..both of them i guess are in somewhere deep down pretty upset with me though they don't show it,as in the last two years i've never heard any of their personal stories except brock's moment of slip of toungue to tell me that he's with someone but then just recoiled again ..but i've grown used to it now..meeting Bonnie,Serena and Clemont has opened my gaze really..i could find my younger self in them and travelling around with them made me realize my mistakes before..of being too preoccupied with training and battling and showboating in Unova..and then a day a certain fangirl surprized me with a kiss in front of public...which was publicized,i realized what she was about to do but it was a moment too late to react and my stubborness to refuse to speak about my private life and laugh it off didn't help me either..this is before our breakup in Unova league parties,she won't talk with me throughout the championship and then finally..and i guess i can't make up with her anymore as i failed in all such pursuits in the following one year and now just have stopped it for about a year itself..
i was may be too egotistical in Unova,i did get the title but for a price that's..well i guess will not be recuperated..
anyhow,its time to go..
(a mile from home)
no..feeling far better now..i guess i'll just try to contact Misty once more..i must try now that my journey's over and have shed off the playboy image they tried to impose upon me in Kalos especially in the last year where i made sure i talk about deep things that public didn't care about and continued to get better at battles while actually rather talking about battles or going to parties i went to libraries and all that more to show my views..apart from Professor Oak and my Mom and to my utter surprize Gary Oak of all people..who would always insist that i was just not that type...everybody did doubt my motive but never showed it as i still was caring to all and above everything what mattered was that my battling skills continued to grow and it continued to develop and at the end i still had 4 consecutive titles,which showed of all things my pokemon wasn't affected at all rather kept on becoming better-which by the way Professor Oak's particular certificate for me that made Serena's parents agree to let her come with me..and now all those even if ever had any doubts doesn't seem to have a problem anymore with me as i've found in their congratulation calls as i guess my character has changed so much and was made available to have a peek at to the reports since i realized my paths had to be rectified especially after my breakup with Misty..Misty herself was always sympathetic with me in the beginning being herself in constant spotlight way more than i ever was with the Sensational Sisters,but probably grew her tired by not considering our personal relationship and being too pre occupied with myself..that i regret the most.. 
but i don't know still whether i can ever get back with Misty again..which is something i secretly want still..or atleast to be able to just talk with her again..
i only laugh now at how false notions and reports can just break out into a nightmare for a person..
(at home,night)
it was a plesent surprize to see Brock and his girlfriend Lucy from battle Frontier..they would make a great couple and so many of my friends May,Max and Drew came,Paul,Dawn hell even Clemont,who actually was the one to plan the party..i can't believe Ritchie also came..Muk won't let me go..neither would my mom nor would Mr Mime..i'm very lucky that my bones are intact still..haha..he actually came to meet Tracy of all people as he wants to be a Pokemon Observer and Trace has made a name for himself i can see.. we stayed up till past 2 in the night..now it's 3:30..really i should sleep..
my friends i've found didn't have any reservations about me anymore at all which was a huge relief for me..
anyhow Lucy suggested meaningfully that i become a Battle Frontier Head as a position may be up for grabs especially with one City running a Gym and a Frontier symbol togather,but i'm not sure yet,besides i had to defend my title in the next 12 months,which was all i decided to do,though i don't know whether i want that even deep down..i just i guess..would be farming..somehow i don't want to leave anymore..
..Sigh..
...Misty,Misty,Misty,Misty...
(two days later afternoon)
had a nice day here at professor Oak's as long as meeting up with all my pokemon here..meeting them here again was the only thing that was good though..Gary cheered me up a lot i don't know how he traced an undecidedness in me at the very first look,his intuition has reached sky high brilliance especially now that he's into research for so many years...but to my biggest surprize Gary and Tracy actually are engaged to Lilly and Daisy respectively while Violet decided to enter fashion designing permanently and moved out of Cerulian..Daisy and Lillie just have given up their show business and now all are in the Lab itself..i was surprized at their change,well they were always very caring to their pokemons at gym but was no good in battling but now they also don't quite want to return to the Sensational Sisters again,which they dissolved a year and half ago..leaving Cerulian and coming to Pallet..and looking after all the pokemon..Trace and Daisy became close during his visits at Cerulian and else which he often did to hang out with Misty,especially that she wanted to keep her links with her travelling days and didn't exactly like being Gym leader or Sensational Four,which she joined just after while i was in Battle Frontier..and Gary and Lillie would become close since at one time he had to visit Cerulian just after they finished their original world tour as Psyduck had just evolved and was behaving strange..Misty and my problems didn't affect theirs,which is something i'm very happy about..i didn't know about them as it was only when our relationship began to strain theirs blossomed,and naturally neither Misty nor Gary or Trace wanted to talk about it with me..i didn't have a hang of myself either..i just before the day of my fifth symbol battle in Battle Frontier somehow confessed to Misty of my feelings,she had by then entered Sensational Four on again complying to her sisters and never quite like the lifestyle either though she only would perform at Cerulian,the city itself went crazy and things just weren't right according to her and while both of us were very relieved to have confessed our long suppressed and misunderstood feelings and was happy to have a connection with a childhood friend..but unlike her i still really didn't understand it and was not serious enough..this actually became worse for both as future would unravel itself..
Professor Oak has completely retired and pretty old now..Gary and Tracy togather are running the Lab,which has grown so much given the fame..they have two separate places now to keep all the pokemon that they have..pretty amusing for a little town like Pallet..but i guess it hasn't been that little anymore..haha..soon to be a township..but my place being at the outskirts still has a feel of villege which is so refreshing..
Daisy and Lillie have been a pretty indifferent to me,just about accepting their their fiancees and trying to get along..Tracy was most upset with me among Misty and my mutual friends but even he i guess just has mellowed down and i didn't find any reservations in him yesterday during the party..Tracy though just brusted out vehemently demanding me to contact Misty as soon as i mentioned her name to him or any who knew our relationship first time in around 2 years..neither did Misty i guess and all thought we've just moved on..but i certainly haven't i've just been too stubborn and she too as usual as i could hear..since our breakup she wont reply to my calls and then i also gave up calling her after an year or so and both would take that moment of heat as final though i've realized it certainly wasn't for me..and i now know it hasn't been for her either..we're just like that actually more so because that was our only fight since becoming a couple and we didn't survive those strenous 3 months..we had never even shouted at each other till those days since she parted after jhoto..
Trace told me to go to Cerulian as soon as i could and eventually told the news that's been gnawing at me now..Misty stays there all alone now..she is also the battle frontier head and Cerulian Gym leader..her reputation is really huge...i don't know how she manages two separate roles in the same gym..but Trace did tell me that she is basically working herself to death and won't listen to anybody and not in a healthy state of mind,the reputation of her is that of a creepy and gloomy one...Tracy informed how some people would turn up at the gym or post show,which she held thrice a week and offer her a date if they won many times as her fame grew more and more with Sensational Sisters..she was really annoyed with it but just like me would just drive any such hazards with all her wrath and i guess it was such a day on which we broke up..but since our breakup she has just basically become a loner more and more only keeping contact now with her sisters..they have one fear for her which i admit is a possibility...with all the psychic pokemon's she has they fear she will become like old Sabrina from Saffron..but as stubborn as she is she won't listen to advices...both she and i had always been extremely stubborn which again was what drew us so close and we were overprotective about each other even in our childhood and later about our relationship and it just had grown complicated for her much more as she was being constantly annoyed at the Gym and during her shows and was hearing how i wasn't being her anymore and despite pressure i refused to tell people about my relationship status..i just didn't want that to come out..
i will have to go to Cerulian and try to defeat her..as much as it'll pain me but i must,if that cures her..and also as a preparation for my Elite 4 challenge if i lose Misty i'll work myself to death in Elite 4 as well as i wouldn't be able to settle down without her i've just realized...but this one if I can win i may as well never battle again..i'm determined..
(back at home,three days later,afternoon)
i'm going to Cerulian tomorrow on Charizard so that it takes just a whisker..i managed to seank into Daisy's room while she was talking with Misty..Mist-the girl that was so dear to me and still is very special..seeing her talking live just brought back all my feelings that i want to forget about her..i guess since i came back really my repressed feelings are about to erupt now that i'm here at home and feeling nostalgic..the Misty i saw was so much different,wearing a black gown,little hair..all the Sensational Four beauty having been evaporated long ago...and seemed eternally dejected..only talking of pokemon..few plesentaries..that's it...since Tracy's words did make my feeling re emerge again..now after seeing her that day as i said i just know i must get Misty back no matter what..
Daisy caught me as she finished the conversation and found me evsdropping and was about to explode but i promised her and Tracy that i'll get her back..it has been my fault completely i realize perfectly now..i must get her back for her family more than myslef...
(Cerulian Gym)
Misty has accepted my challenge..the gym is still water type but offers both a badge and a battle frontier symbol whichever you're competing for...the place looks gloomy and the pokemon looked ok but i could sense that they didn't like outside people much..i've finally managed to get Pikachu into a pokeball as i had to..amusingly he realized and went in after 13 years outside..but not before giving me a good thunderbolt..no,i do feel guilty..i didn't expect the situation to be this serious or that my feeling for her would suddenly erupt like this..i took two days to get into the midset of battling and i've come here today with a well chalked plan with all of my water type Pokemons who knows Misty...but it won't be a normal battle neither emotionally nor literally..my plan though is considered successful if only i can get Misty back with her family and friends,not before no matter how well it has gone so far..
