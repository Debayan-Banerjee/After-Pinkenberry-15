(next noon,inside Ash's mind)

i'm so,so happy to get that bouncing,whining,ever energetic girl back in my life again..Misty..the great grave Cerulian Gym Leader,Water Gym Legend,Sensational Sister..i know how childish you are in reality..well the first thing she did in the morning was to bounce and knock at my door as hard as she could only to realize that i didn't shut it after i returned..Misty entered my room like a roller coaster exactly at 6:15,when we started our gym battle a week ago..i realized Misty is back to me as soon as i saw her face..i just so much longed for that broad heartwarming smile of yours Mist...:)..
then Misty just screeched that i was an "idiot" to express how happy she was to get back with me..insisted that i cook for her today and started to jump around in my room whining that i cheated (which she repeatd as loudly as she could five times-the number of times when we battled against each other)and coerced me to give her all my badges and also Pikachu and all the other pokemons that i had with me,and finally left every corner of the room in a complete mess so that she would taunt me later for uncleanliness and Mom shouts at me again thinking that i indeed did cheat on her while she gets to enjoy the scene sticking her toungue out at me all the time..that's just Misty being Misty...:)..this was the beginning and she then also later took away all my titles and other papers and a few gadgets that i keep with me her basically snatching away my entire trophy collection and my books,clotheseverything she could get her hand to or Starew,Starmie,Golduck,Mr Mime,Bulbasaur and Pikachu could saying now she decides whether i get to stay here or not..she was poured into my trophies and other belongings a few minutes ago i saw,as much as she enjoyes my trophies,i guess she still thinks somewhere deep down that those are what separated us in the first place and don't want me to mingle with them again keeping it herself..i wonder how she missed doing all this messing around for all this years..
Lillie left at 5:30 in the morning as Gary picked her up to leave for a long research tour to Jhoto..i saw them off and just about dozed a bit returning to my room..when Misty did finally decide that she should be lording over me again and just brusted into my room..thank you Mist..:)..and i'll be back nicknaming you as well..:)..
my mom was a bit shocked for sure..haha..but as she realized,it's just that i need to be bossed around at every step by Misty..:)..funny how she reintroduced herself..my poem did work then..finally..haha..but i'm just happy that she healed so quickly overnight..:)..i'll get her a ring tomorrow morning as soon as i can..that's what she actually wants..:)..

(next afternoon)

Ah,finally could give Misty a ring and get engaged to her..:)..i wonder why i didn't do it before really..anyhow alls well that ends well..it wasn't easy though,as she would first demand me to compete in the Elite 4 Championship else she'll not get engaged..only after i promised she would accept the ring...i have no idea how she sensed my reluctance..but i've just learnt how lucky i'm to have her beside me..:)..
but we will have to officially announce our engagement sooner than later given the buzz around and to be honest i want to throw this news at the faces..here is what i'm and who my Fiancee is- Misty,Kanto's toughest Gym Leader,Sensational Sister,Water Gym Legend and that too just at the age of 25 and i can go on and and on-just have a look for youself and leave us alone..this is why i didn't tell you before as i waited for this moment,it's not just whom i'm being with but i'm engaged to-Misty-this is exactly who she is..
but i'm also just having a real laugh thinking that a clueless lad and an ever scoffing,scowling girl who got almost killed at their very first accident in a forest has got engaged and this has to be a news..really this is crazy..i don't know how we managed to do all these but with me and Misty togather things never have gone normally..she really has lit me up once again..:)..and i realize her sorrow now as well with her insistant deman of Elite 4 Challenge participation rather than marrying and settling down immediately-all she wants is to travel with her Ash again but this time all alone and as a couple,see me win the Elite 4 Challenge especially in regions where she couldn't be with me..and i'll get the score settled for sure..i'm pretty determined..even if i don't win 6 i'll atleast try to win Unova and Kalos once more as those two regions hold a soft spot in both our hearts..especially for Mist,how badly she wanted to be with me in those two places...but now that she will again be travelling with me i wonder who the mediater should be..:)..
